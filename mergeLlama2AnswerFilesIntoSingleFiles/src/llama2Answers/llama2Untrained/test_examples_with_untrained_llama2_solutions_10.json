The volume of the box is 10 inches x 3 inches = 30 cubic inches. The volume of the stack of nickels is 100 nickels x 0.0625 inches = 6.25 cubic inches. Since the volume of the box is greater than the volume of the stack of nickels, we can fit more than 100 nickels in the box. The exact number of nickels that can fit in the box is 100 / 6.25 = 16 nickels."
