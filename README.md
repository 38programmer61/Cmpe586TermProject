# Cmpe586TermProject
Repository for the term project of Cmpe 586 course

For the fine tuning part, I mainly followed the [Efficient Fine-Tuning for Llama-v2-7b on a Single GPU Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ly01S--kUwkKQalE-75skalp-ftwl0fE?usp=sharing). The details of the hyperparameters are already shared in the project report.

The scores I assinged to different model can be found in the "Evaluating Answers On Test Set" section.
