Since we have collected data on the number of students in each of the 5 classes, we can use this information to create a linear regression equation.\n\nThe linear regression equation is:\n\nTotal Number of Students = a + b \\* Number of Students in Class 1 + c \\* Number of Students in Class 2 + d \\* Number of Students in Class 3 + e \\* Number of Students in Class 4 + f \\* Number of Students in Class 5\n\nwhere a, b, c, d, e, and f are constants that need to be estimated using the data collected.\n\nTo estimate these constants, we can use a technique called least squares regression. This involves minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed values of the total number of students and the predicted values.\n\nOnce we have estimated the constants a, b, c, d, e, and f, we can use the linear regression equation to predict the total number of students in the school. For example, if the number of students in Class 1 is 25, the number of students in Class 2 is 30, and so on, we can plug these values into the linear regression equation to get an estimate of the total number of students in the school.\n\nTherefore, the response to Angie's task is to use a linear regression model to predict the total number of students in the school based on the data collected on the number of students in each of the 5 classes."
