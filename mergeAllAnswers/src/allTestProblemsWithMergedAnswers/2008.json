    "chatgpt_solution": "For a certain number of oranges $n$ at $3x$ cents each, Kim's supply of money is $40\\cdot3x=120x$ cents. Because she had exactly enough money to buy these 40 oranges, $n$ satisfies $\\frac{120x}{n}=3x$, or $n=40$.

    "manual_solution": "If the total cost is fixed, then the relationship between cost per item and the number of items is inversely proportional.  Since each orange costs $\\frac{4}{3}$ as much, the same amount of money purchases $\\frac{3}{4}$ as many of them.  Taking three-fourths of 40, we find that Kim could buy $\\boxed{30}$ oranges.",
