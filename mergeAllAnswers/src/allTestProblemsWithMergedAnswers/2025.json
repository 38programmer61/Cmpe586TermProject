    "llama2_trained_with_chatgpt_labels_solution": "we know that distance = rate x time, so we can set up the equation:\n\ndistance = 60 miles/hour x time\n\nwe also know that time = distance / rate\n\nsubstituting the values we know, we get:\n\ntime = 20 miles / 60 miles/hour\n\ntime = 1/3 hours\n\ntherefore, it will take jeremiah 1/3 hour to travel 20 miles.\n\nin minutes, this is:\n\n1/3 hour x 60 minutes/hour = <<1/3*60=20>>20 minutes\n\ntherefore, it will take jeremiah 20 minutes to travel 20 miles. answer: \\boxed{20}.",
