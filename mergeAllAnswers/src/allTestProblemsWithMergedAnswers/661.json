    "llama2_trained_with_manual_labels_solution": "let $d$ be the number of days in the month of February.  since suzanne walks four miles every third day, she walks a total of $4d/3$ miles in February.  since $d$ is a multiple of 3, $4d/3$ is also a multiple of 3, so $4d/3$ is a multiple of 3.  the smallest multiple of 3 that is greater than 0 is 3, so $4d/3=3\\cdot3=9$ miles.  thus, suzanne walks a total of 9 miles in February.",
