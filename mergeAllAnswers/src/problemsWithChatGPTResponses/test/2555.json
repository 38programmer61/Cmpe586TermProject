    "problem": "What is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the line that passes through the point $(2,-3)$ and has slope $\\frac12$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "A point-slope form of the equation is \\[y - (-3) = \\frac{1}{2}(x-2).\\]Multiplying both sides by 2 gives $2(y+3) = x-2$, and rearranging this gives $x - 2y =8$.  Letting $x=0$ and solving for $y$ gives us the desired $y$-coordinate of $\\boxed{-4}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The point-slope form of the equation of a line is $y-y_1=m(x-x_1),$ where $(x_1,y_1)$ is a point on the line.  We substitute $m=\\frac12,$ $x_1=2,$ and $y_1=-3$ to find  \\[y-(-3)=\\frac12(x-2).\\] Simplifying the right side gives $\\frac12x-1,$ so \\[y+3=\\frac12x-1.\\] Subtracting 3 from both sides gives $y=\\frac12x-4.$  The $y$-intercept occurs when $x=0,$ so $y=\\frac12(0)-4=\\boxed{-4}.$ [asy]\nunitsize(0.4 cm);\n\npair[] A, B;\n\nA[1] = (0,-4);\nA[2] = (10,-1);\nB[1] = (2,-3);\n\ndraw((-1,-5)--(12,1),Arrow(6));\ndraw((-1,-2)--(12,-6),Arrow(6));\ndraw((0,0)--(12,0));\ndraw((0,-8)--(0,2));\n\ndot(\"$y = \\frac{1}{2}x - 4$\", (12,1), E);\n\nlabel(\"$x$\", (13,0));\nlabel(\"$y$\", (0,2));\n[/asy]"
