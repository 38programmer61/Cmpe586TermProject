    "problem": "Find the value of $x$ that satisfies $\\frac{1}{3x-1} = \\frac{2}{x+1}$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Cross multiplying, we obtain $ x+1 = 2(3x-1)$. (This is the same thing as multiplying both sides by both $3x-1$ and by $x+1$.)  Then, we solve for $x$: \\begin{align*}\nx+1 &= 2(3x-1)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad x+1 &= 6x-2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad-5x &= -3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad x &= \\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Cross-multiplication gives $2(3x-1) = (x+1)$, or $6x-2 = x+1$. Simplifying gives $5x = 3$, so $x = \\boxed{\\frac35}$."
