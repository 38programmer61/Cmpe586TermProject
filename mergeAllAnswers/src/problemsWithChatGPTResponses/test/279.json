    "problem": "Find the largest value of $c$ such that $\\frac{c^2 + 6c -27}{c-3} +2c = 23$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Factoring the quadratic gives $\\frac{(c-3)(c+9)}{c-3} +2c= 23$.  Canceling the common factor gives $c+9 + 2c = 23$.  Solving this equation gives $c = \\boxed{\\frac{14}{3}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "First we note that $c\\neq 3$ because of the denominator. Since we have an expression with $c-3$ in the denominator, we can invoke Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick: add and subtract $9$ in the numerator to get \\[\\frac{c^2 + 6c -27}{c-3} +2c =\\frac{c^2 + 6c -27+9-9}{c-3} +2c=\\frac{c^2 + 6c -18}{c-3} +(2c-6)\\] Factoring the numerator in the fraction, we get \\[\\frac{(c-3)(c+9)}{c-3} +(2c-6)=c+9+2c-6=3c+3\\] Thus we have $3c+3=23$, so $3c=20$ and $c = \\boxed{\\frac{20}{3}}$. We can check that this solution works by inserting $\\frac{20}{3}$ back into the equation; alternatively, since we used $c\\neq 3$ in our first manipulation, $c=3$ would not be a valid solution anyway."
