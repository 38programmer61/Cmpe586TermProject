                "content": "We can set up a proportion to solve this problem.\n\nThe ratio of students wearing red in Angie's class to the total number of students in her class is 11/24.\n\nLet x represent the total number of students wearing red in the school.\n\nSo the proportion is 11/24 = x/480.\n\nSimplifying the proportion, we get 11 * 480 = 24 * x.\n\nMultiplying, we get 5280 = 24x.\n\nDividing both sides by 24, we find x = 220.\n\nTherefore, Angie estimates that 220 students in her school will be wearing red on Valentine's Day.",
