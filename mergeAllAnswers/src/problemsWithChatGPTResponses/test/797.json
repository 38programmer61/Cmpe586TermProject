    "problem": "The largest and smallest of three consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence differ by 14. Half of the smallest term is added to each term and the sum of the resulting three numbers is 120. What is the value of the original smallest term?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the three terms $a$, $a+d$, and $a+2d$, in increasing order. We are told that the largest and smallest terms differ by 14, so $(a+2d)-a=2d=14$ or $d=7$.\n\nAfter adding half the smallest term to each term, they become $\\frac32a$, $\\frac32a+7$, and $\\frac32a+14$. Their sum is $\\frac92a+21=120$, which gives $\\frac92a=99$ or $a=\\boxed{22}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the middle term be $x.$ Then the smallest term is $x - 7$ and the largest term is $x + 7.$ Therefore, our three numbers are $x - 7,$ $x,$ and $x + 7.$ Half of the smallest term is added to each of these, and the resulting three numbers sum to 120, so we have the equation $$\\left(\\frac{x-7}{2}\\right)+x+\\left(\\frac{x+7}{2}\\right)=120.$$Simplifying the left side gives $$\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-7+x+7}{2}\\right)=\\frac{2x}{4}=\\frac{x}{2},$$so our equation is $\\frac{x}{2} + x + \\frac{x}{2} = 120.$ Combining like terms gives $\\frac{2x}{2} + x = 120,$ or $3x = 120,$ so $x = 40.$ The smallest term is $x - 7 = \\boxed{33}.$"
