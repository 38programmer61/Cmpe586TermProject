                "content": "For simplicity, we begin by multiplying the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $3$ to cancel out the coefficients of $y$: \\begin{align*}\n12x+8y&=14, \\\\\n3Kx+24y&=21.\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we have $$\\begin{aligned} (3K-12)x+(24-8)y&=21-14 \\\\ 0 \\cdot x+16y &=7. \\end{aligned}$$ Since $0x = 0$ for any real number $x,$ this reduces to $16y = 7.$ Dividing both sides of the equation by $16$ gives us $y= \\frac78.$\n\nSubstituting $y=\\frac78$ into $6x+4y=7$, we have \\begin{align*}\n6x+4\\left(\\frac78\\right)&=7 \\\\\n6x+\\frac{16}{8}&=7 \\\\\n6x+2&=7 \\\\\n6x&=5\\\\\nx&=\\frac{5}{6}.\n\\end{align*} Thus, a valid solution $(x,y)$ exists. Since we assumed otherwise, our assumption must be false. Thus, the system has at least one solution for any value of $K.$ Therefore, $K = \\boxed{\\text{anything}}$ is a valid solution.",
