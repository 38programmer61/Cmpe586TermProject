                "content": "To calculate how many cups of flour are needed for 2 five-pound cakes, we need to adjust the quantities proportionally. \n\nSince the ingredient is flour, it is necessary to keep the ratio of flour to cake constant. \n\nGiven that the original recipe calls for 1.5 cups of flour for a two-pound cake, we can set up a proportion to find the amount of flour needed for one five-pound cake.\n\n1.5 cups of flour / 2 pounds of cake = X cups of flour / 5 pounds of cake\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n1.5 * 5 = 2 * X\n\n7.5 = 2X\n\nX = 7.5 / 2\n\nX = 3.75\n\nTherefore, one five-pound cake requires 3.75 cups of flour. \n\nFor 2 five-pound cakes, we will double that amount:\n\n2 * 3.75 cups of flour = 7.5 cups of flour\n\nTherefore, 7.5 cups of flour are needed for 2 five-pound cakes.",
