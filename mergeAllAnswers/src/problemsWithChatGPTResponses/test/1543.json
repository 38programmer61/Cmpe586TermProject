    "problem": "Angie decided to use her class as a sample to predict the total number of students in her school wearing red on Valentine's Day. She counted 11 students wearing red in her class of 24 students. Using this ratio, how many of the 480 students in her school will she estimate are wearing red?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can use the given information to set up a ratio and solve for the number of kids in the school that are wearing red.  Let $x$ equal the total number of students wearing red in the school.  From the given information, we have$$\\frac{11}{24}=\\frac{x}{480},$$so  $$x=\\frac{480\\cdot 11}{24},$$which means $$x=20\\cdot 11=\\boxed{220}.$$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We can set up a proportion to solve this problem.\n\nThe ratio of students wearing red in Angie's class to the total number of students in her class is 11/24.\n\nLet x represent the total number of students wearing red in the school.\n\nSo the proportion is 11/24 = x/480.\n\nSimplifying the proportion, we get 11 * 480 = 24 * x.\n\nMultiplying, we get 5280 = 24x.\n\nDividing both sides by 24, we find x = 220.\n\nTherefore, Angie estimates that 220 students in her school will be wearing red on Valentine's Day."
