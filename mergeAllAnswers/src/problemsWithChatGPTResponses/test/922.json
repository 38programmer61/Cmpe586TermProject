    "problem": "How many units long is a line segment whose endpoints have coordinates $(-3,7)$ and $(2,-5)$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(2 - (-3))^2 + ((-5) - 7)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 144} = \\boxed{13}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nWe note that the points $(-3, 7)$, $(2, -5)$, and $(-3, -5)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 5 and 12. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the hypotenuse has length $\\boxed{13}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Using the distance formula, the length of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$. Thus, the length of the line segment is $\\sqrt{(2-(-3))^2+(-5-7)^2}=\\sqrt{5^2+(-12)^2}=\\sqrt{25+144}=\\sqrt{169}=\\boxed{13}$."
