    "problem": "What is the positive difference between the sum of the first 20 positive multiples of 5 and the sum of the first 20 positive, even integers?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the first 20 positive multiples of 5 is $5+10+15+\\cdots+95+100 = 5 (1 + 2 + \\dots + 20)$.  For all $n$, $1 + 2 + \\dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so $5 (1 + 2 + \\dots + 20) = 5 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 21/2 = 1050$.\n\nThe sum of the first 20 positive even integers is $2+4+6+8+\\cdots+38+40 = 2 (1 + 2 + \\dots + 20) = 2 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 21/2 = 420$.  The difference is $1050-420=\\boxed{630}.$\n\nAlternatively, we can subtract the sums, to get\n\\begin{align*}\n5(1 + 2 + \\dots + 20) - 2(1 + 2 + \\dots + 20) &= 3 (1 + 2 + \\dots + 20) \\\\\n&= 3 \\cdot \\frac{20 \\cdot 21}{2} \\\\\n&= 630.\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The sum of the first 20 positive multiples of 5 is $5+10+15+\\dots+100$. The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so this sum is $(5+100)/2\\cdot20=50\\cdot20=1000$.\n\nThe sum of the first 20 positive even integers is $2+4+6+\\dots+40$. Again, the sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so this sum is $(2+40)/2\\cdot20=42\\cdot10=420$.\n\nThe positive difference between these two sums is $1000-420=\\boxed{580}$."
