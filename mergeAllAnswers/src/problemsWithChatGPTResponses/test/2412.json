    "problem": "The second and ninth terms of an arithmetic sequence are 2 and 30, respectively. What is the fiftieth term?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the first term, and let $d$ be the common difference.  Then the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term is $a + (n - 1)d$.  In particular, the second term is $a + d = 2$, and the ninth term is $a + 8d = 30$.  Subtracting these equations, we get $7d = 28$, so $d = 4$.  Substituting this into the equation $a + d = 2$, we get $a + 4 = 2$, so $a = -2$.\n\nThen the fiftieth term is $a + 49d = -2 + 49 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{194}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the first term be $a$ and the common difference be $d$.  Then the second term is $a + d$, and the ninth term is $a + 8d$.  We are given that $a + d = 2$ and $a + 8d = 30$, so $8d = 30 - 2 = 28$.  Then $d = 3.5$, so the fiftieth term is $a + 49d = 2 + 49(3.5) = \\boxed{172}$."
