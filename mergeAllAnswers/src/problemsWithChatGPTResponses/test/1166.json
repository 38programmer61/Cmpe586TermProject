    "problem": "For what value of $x$ will $\\frac{2x-1}{2x+2}$ and $\\frac{x-3}{x-1}$ be equal?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have the equation $\\frac{2x-1}{2x+2}=\\frac{x-3}{x-1}$. Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we get \\begin{align*}\n(2x-1)(x-1)&=(2x+2)(x-3)\\\\\n2x^2 - x - 2x + 1 &= 2x^2 + 2x - 3 \\cdot 2x - 3 \\cdot 2 \\\\\n2x^2 - 3x + 1&=2x^2-4x-6\\\\\nx&=\\boxed{-7}\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since the two ratios are equal, their numerators and denominators must be equal. Thus, $2x-1 = x-3$, and $2x+2 = x-1.$ Solving for $x$ in each equation gives $x = \\boxed{2}$ and $x = -3.$ However, we also must check that these solutions do not make any of the denominators equal to $0.$ Checking the value $x = -3$ in the second fraction, we see that the denominator becomes $(-3)-1 = -4,$ so we must disregard this value. Thus the answer is $x = \\boxed{2}.$"
