    "problem": "Suppose that $f$ is a polynomial such that \\[(x-1)\\cdot f(x)=3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17.\\]What is the degree of $f$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the product of $f$ and a polynomial with degree 1 equals a polynomial with degree 4, we know that $f$ is a polynomial with degree $4-1=\\boxed{3}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The degree of a polynomial $p(x)$ is the highest degree among the terms of $p(x)$. Here, when we multiply $(x-1) \\cdot f(x)$, all the terms will have $x$ to some positive exponent. Therefore, the degree of $(x-1) f(x)$ is the same as the degree of $f(x)$. To see this, recall that for any nonzero constant $a$, the degree of $ax^n$ is $n$. So the degree of $(x-1) f(x)$ is the degree of each of its terms. We can use the distributive property to expand $(x-1) f(x)$ and collect like terms:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(x-1) f(x) &= (x \\cdot f(x)) - (1 \\cdot f(x)) \\\\\n&= x \\cdot [3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17] - (f(x)).\n\\end{align*}The $x \\cdot [3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17]$ term is $3x^5 + x^4 - 25x^3 + 38x^2 - 17x$, and the $-(f(x))$ term is $-f(x)$. Adding these gives  \\[(x-1) f(x) = 3x^5 + x^4 - 25x^3 + 38x^2 - 17x - f(x).\\]Since this is equal to the given polynomial $3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17$, by comparing coefficients, we must have $f(x) = \\boxed{-3x^4 - x^3 + 13x^2 - 21x + 17}$. We can check that this is the divisor we need by performing the polynomial long division."
