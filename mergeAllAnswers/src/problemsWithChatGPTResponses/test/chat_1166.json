                "content": "Since the two ratios are equal, their numerators and denominators must be equal. Thus, $2x-1 = x-3$, and $2x+2 = x-1.$ Solving for $x$ in each equation gives $x = \\boxed{2}$ and $x = -3.$ However, we also must check that these solutions do not make any of the denominators equal to $0.$ Checking the value $x = -3$ in the second fraction, we see that the denominator becomes $(-3)-1 = -4,$ so we must disregard this value. Thus the answer is $x = \\boxed{2}.$",
