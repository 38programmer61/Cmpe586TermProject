    "problem": "What is the length of the segment of the number line consisting of the points that satisfy $(x-4)^2 \\le 9$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the square of $x-4$ is at most 9, the value of $x-4$ must be between $-3$ and $3$ (or equal to either). So, we have $-3 \\le x-4 \\le 3$. Thus, $1 \\le x \\le 7$. Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{6}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nIf $(x-4)^2 \\le 9$, then $x$ can be no more than 3 away from 4.  Therefore, the values of $x$ from 1 to 7 satisfy the inequality, and our answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",
