                "content": "The area of the original screen is $24 \\times 16 = 384$ square inches. Increasing both dimensions by $20 \\%$ is equivalent to increasing the length and width by $\\frac{20}{100} = 0.2$ times their original values. Thus, the new dimensions are $1.2 \\times 24 = 28.8$ inches and $1.2 \\times 16 = 19.2$ inches. The area of the new screen is $28.8 \\times 19.2 = 552.96$ square inches. So the area is increased by $\\frac{552.96-384}{384} = \\frac{168.96}{384} \\approx \\frac{169}{384}$. Converting this to percent gives $\\frac{169}{384} \\times 100\\% \\approx \\boxed{44\\%}$.",
