    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We are asked to calculate $9+18+27+\\cdots+63$.  Factor out 9 and use the identity $1+2+3+\\cdots+n=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ to find that $9+18+\\cdots+63=9(1+2+\\dots+7)= 9 \\cdot \\frac{7 \\cdot 8}{2} = \\boxed{252}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The seven smallest distinct positive integer multiples of 9 are $9,$ $18,$ $27,$ $36,$ $45,$ $54,$ and $63,$ and their sum is $9 + 18 + 27 + 36 + 45 + 54 + 63 = \\boxed{252}.$"
