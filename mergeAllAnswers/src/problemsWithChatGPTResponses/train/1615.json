    "problem": "A rectangular box has a volume of 108 cubic feet. How many cubic yards are in the volume of this box?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since there are 3 feet to a yard, there are $3^3=27$ cubic feet to a cubic yard. Thus, there are $108/27=\\boxed{4}$ cubic yards in the volume of the box.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "There are 3 feet in a yard, so there are (3 ft)^3 = 27 cubic ft in a cubic yard.\nThus, there are 108 cubic ft / 27 cubic ft per yard = <<108/27=4>>4 cubic yards in the volume of this box. Answer: \\boxed{4}."
