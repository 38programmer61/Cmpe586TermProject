    "solution": "The coefficient of $x^2$ in $4(x - x^3) - 3(x^2 - x^3 + x^5) + 2(4x^2 - x^9)$ is $-3 + 2 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We distribute each product over the expression in the given expression.\n\nFor the first term, we have $4(x - x^3) = 4x - 4x^3 = -4x^3 + 4x.$ For the second term, we distribute the $-3$ to get $-3(x^2 - x^3 + x^5) = -3x^2 + 3x^3 - 3x^5.$ For the third term, we distribute the $2$ to get $2(4x^2 - x^9) = 8x^2 - 2x^9.$\n\nTherefore, $4(x - x^3) - 3(x^2 - x^3 + x^5) + 2(4x^2 - x^9) = (-4x^3 + 4x) - (-3x^2 + 3x^3 - 3x^5) + (8x^2 - 2x^9),$ which reduces to $-2x^9 - 3x^5 + 7x^3 - 3x + 4x.$\n\nThe coefficient of $x^2$ in this expression is $\\boxed{7}.$"
