    "problem": "The product of three even consecutive positive integers is twenty times their sum. What is the sum of the three integers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the three integers $x-2$, $x$, and $x+2$. We know that $(x-2)x(x+2) = 20(x-2 + x + x+2)$, or $(x^2-4)x = 20(3x)$. Canceling an $x$ on either side gives $(x^2 - 4) = 60$, so $x^2 = 64$. Thus, $x = 8$, (since the numbers are positive), so the sum of the three integers is $3 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{24}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the three integers be $2n,$ $2n + 2,$ and $2n + 4,$ for some positive integer $n.$  Then\n\\[(2n)(2n + 2)(2n + 4) = 20(6n + 6).\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[8n^3 + 24n^2 + 16n = 120n + 120.\\]Then $8n^3 + 24n^2 - 104n - 120 = 0,$ which factors as $2(n - 1)(2n + 5)(n + 4) = 0.$  The positive solution is $n = 1,$ so the sum of the three integers is $2 + 4 + 6 = \\boxed{12}.$"
