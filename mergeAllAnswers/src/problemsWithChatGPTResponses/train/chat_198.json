                "content": "Let $n$ be the middle of the three consecutive integers, so the three integers are $n-2, n,$ and $n+2$. We can rewrite our equation as $$3n = \\frac{(n-2)(n)(n+2)}{7}.$$Cross multiplying and expanding the right side gives us $21n = n^3 - 4$. Rearranging and moving the terms to one side, we have $n^3 - 21n - 4 = 0.$ At this point, we could try values of $n$ starting at $0.$ However, one should realize that graphing is the easiest way to solve this cubic. The LHS increases much faster than the RHS, so there is only one real root. Even though this cubic does not factor nicely, note that \\begin{align*}\nn = 3 &\\implies 3^3 - 21\\cdot 3 - 4 = 27 - 63 - 4 = -40 < 0 \\\\\nn = 4 &\\implies 4^3 - 21\\cdot 4 - 4 = 64 - 84 - 4 = -24 < 0\\\\\nn = 5 &\\implies 5^3 - 21\\cdot 5 - 4 = 125 - 105 - 4 = 16 > 0\\\\\nn = 6 &\\implies 6^3 - 21\\cdot 6 - 4 = 216 - 126 - 4 = 86 > 0\n\\end{align*} The Rational Root Theorem is also possible, but the only roots that \"make sense\" are at $-1, -2, 1, 2,$ and these are easy to check.\n\nThus, the possible values of $n$ are $5$ or $6,$ and we can check that only $n = \\boxed{6}$ works. Indeed, the three consecutive integers are $4, 6, 8,$ which sum to $18$ and have a product of $192, $ so our answer is correct. $\\square$",
