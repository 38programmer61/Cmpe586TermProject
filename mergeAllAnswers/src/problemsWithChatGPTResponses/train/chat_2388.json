                "content": "Let $m$ be the number of male members and $f$ the number of female members. The total age contribution of the female members is $40f$ and the total age contribution of the male members is $25m$. Therefore the total age contribution of all the members is $40f + 25m$, which we are given to be $30(m + f)$. Simplifying, we find \\begin{align*}\n40f + 25m &= 30(m + f)\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad 10f &= 5m\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2f &= m\n\\end{align*} Therefore the ratio of females to males is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
