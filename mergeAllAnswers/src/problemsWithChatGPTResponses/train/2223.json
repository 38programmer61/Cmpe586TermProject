    "problem": "Suppose $p(x)$ is a function such that $p(x) + (x^5+3x^3+9x) = (7x^3+24x^2+25x+1)$.  Express $p(x)$ as a polynomial with the degrees of the terms in decreasing order.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Isolating $p(x),$ we have: \\begin{align*}\np(x)&=(7x^3+24x^2+25x+1)-(x^5+3x^3+9x)\\\\\n&=-x^5+(7-3)x^3+24x^2+(25-9)x+1\\\\\n&=\\boxed{-x^5+4x^3+24x^2+16x+1}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We can subtract $(x^5+3x^3+9x)$ from both sides of the equation to find $$p(x) = (7x^3+24x^2+25x+1)-(x^5+3x^3+9x)=7x^3+24x^2+25x+1-x^5-3x^3-9x.$$Now we combine like terms and write the polynomial with the terms in decreasing order of degree.  We get $$p(x) = -x^5 + (7x^3 - 3x^3) + 24x^2 + (25x - 9x) +1 = \\boxed{-x^5 + 4x^3 + 24x^2 + 16x + 1}.$$"
