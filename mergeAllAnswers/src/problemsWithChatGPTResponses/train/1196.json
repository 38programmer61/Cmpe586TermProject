    "problem": "For what value of $x$ is the expression $\\frac{2x^3+3}{x^2-20x+100}$ not defined?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The only time this expression is not defined is when the denominator is equal to 0. In other words, we are looking for all solutions to the equation $x^2 - 20x + 100 = 0$. We can find the roots by factoring the quadratic into $(x - 10)(x - 10) = 0$ or by using the quadratic formula: $$x = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{(-20)^2-4(1)(100)}}{2}.$$ Either way, we see that $x = 10$ is the only time when the denominator of our expression is equal to 0. Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The expression is not defined when the denominator is equal to 0. To find when the denominator $x^2-20x+100$ is equal to 0, we can find when the quadratic equation $x^2-20x+100=0$ has solutions. This quadratic will have solutions when its discriminant, $b^2-4ac$, is non-negative. In this case, the discriminant is $(-20)^2 - 4(1)(100) = 400 - 400 = 0$. Since the discriminant is 0, the quadratic equation $x^2-20x+100=0$ has one solution. Thus, the expression $\\frac{2x^3+3}{x^2-20x+100}$ is not defined when $x^2-20x+100=0$, which is true when $x = \\boxed{10}$."
