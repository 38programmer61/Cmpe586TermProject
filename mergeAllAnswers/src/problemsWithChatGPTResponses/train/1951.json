    "problem": "If the system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero, find $\\frac{a}{b},$ assuming $b$ is nonzero.",

    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If we multiply the first equation by $-\\frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$, we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Solving the second equation for $y$ gives $y=\\frac{9x}{6} = \\frac{3}{2}x.$ Substituting this into the first equation gives $6x - 4\\cdot\\frac{3}{2}x = a,$ or $6x - 6x = a,$ which implies $a=0.$ Note that the equation $6y-9x=b$ turns into $0=b.$ Since $b$ is nonzero, we cannot satisfy this equation. Thus there are no solutions with $x$ and $y$ both nonzero, so $\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{0}{b} = \\boxed{0}.$"
