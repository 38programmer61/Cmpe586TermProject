    "problem": "What value of $x$ will give the minimum value for $x^2- 10x + 24$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We start by completing the square.  \\[x^2-10x+24=(x-5)^2-1.\\] Since the square of a real number is at least 0, $(x-5)^2\\ge 0$ and $(x-5)^2-1 \\ge -1.$ Thus, the minimum value of the quadratic is $-1,$ which occurs when $x=\\boxed{5}.$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We complete the square: \\begin{align*}\nx^2-10x + 24 &= (x^2-10x +25) - 1\\\\\n&=(x-5)^2-1.\n\\end{align*}We see that $(x-5)^2\\geq 0,$ so $(x-5)^2-1\\geq 0-1=-1$. There is no value of $x$ that produces a value less than $-1,$ but any value of $x$ that produces $x=5$ attains the minimum of $-1$, so $x=\\boxed{5}$."
