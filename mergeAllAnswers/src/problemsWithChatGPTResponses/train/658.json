    "problem": "If $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive with $xy=24$, $xz = 48$, and $yz=72$, what is the value of $x+y+z$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $$x=\\frac{24}{y}=\\frac{48}{z}$$ we have $z = 2y$. So $72\n= 2y^2$, which implies that $y=6$, $x = 4$, and $z = 12$. Hence $x+y+z = \\boxed{22}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We multiply all three given equations and find that $x^2y^2z^2 = (xyz)^2 = (24)(48)(72) = (3^3)(2^4)(2^3)(3^2)(2^3)(3^2) = 2^7 \\cdot 3^5$.  We see that multiplying the first equation by the square of the third equation yields, when combined with the second equation, that $x^2y^2z^2 = (xy)(xz)(yz) = (xyz)^2$, so all three numbers are equal to $2^{\\frac{7}{2}}3^{\\frac{5}{2}}$.  So, $x+y+z = \\frac{7}{2}+\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{7}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{19}{2}}$."
