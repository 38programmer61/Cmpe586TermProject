    "problem": "For what values of $z$ is $z^2-40z+340\\le 4$? Express your answer in interval notation.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can simplify the inequality to $z^2-40z+336\\le 0$. We could solve for the roots using the quadratic formula, but there is an easier solution by factoring: $z^2-40z+336=(z-12)(z-28)$. Thus the parabola $z^2-40z+336$ changes sign at $z=12$ and $z=28$. The solution is either the interval $(-\\infty,12]\\cup[28,\\infty)$ or $[12,28]$. We test values to find that the quadratic is non-positive over the interval $\\boxed{[12,28]}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Subtracting 4 from both sides gives  \\[z^2-40z+336\\le 0.\\]The left side factors as $(z-4)(z-84)\\le 0$. The quadratic is equal to 0 when $z=4$ and $z=84$.  Both factors are positive when $z<4$ and both factors are negative when $84<z$. For $0\\le z\\le4$, the quadratic is nonpositive. For $4\\le z\\le84$, the quadratic is nonnegative.  Our answer is the interval $\\boxed{[0,4]\\cup[4,84]}$."
