    "problem": "What is the greatest product obtainable from two integers whose sum is 1998?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the two integers be $x$ and $1998-x$. The product which needs to be maximized is $1998x-x^2$. Completing the square results in $-(x-999)^2+999^2$. Since $-(x-999)^2\\le 0$, the expression is maximized when $x=999$, which results in a value of $999^2=\\boxed{998001}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "In order to find the greatest product obtainable from two integers whose sum is 1998, we need to find the two integers that are as close to each other as possible. This is because the product of two numbers is maximum when they are equal.\n\nSo, let's name the two integers as x and y, such that x + y = 1998.\n\nIn order to maximize the product, let's assume both x and y are close to each other, i.e., x \u2248 y. Now, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2x \u2248 1998\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\nx \u2248 1998/2\nx \u2248 999\n\nSince the sum of the two integers should be 1998, y = 1998 - x:\ny = 1998 - 999\ny = 999\n\nTherefore, the two integers that maximize the product are x = 999 and y = 999. The greatest product obtainable from these two integers is:\n\nProduct = x * y = 999 * 999 = 998001\n\nHence, the greatest product obtainable from two integers whose sum is 1998 is 998001."
