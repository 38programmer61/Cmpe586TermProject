    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We calculate as follows: \\[\n|{-3^2+4}|=|{-9+4}|=|{-5}|=\\boxed{5}.\\] Note that $-3^2=-9$ because our conventions for carrying out operations dictate that exponentiation should be done before negation. Hence $-3^2$ means $-(3^2)$ rather than $(-3)^2$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "First, we evaluate the expression inside the absolute value:\n\n$-3^2 = -9$\n\nNext, we take the absolute value of $-9$:\n\n$|-9| = \\boxed{9}$"
