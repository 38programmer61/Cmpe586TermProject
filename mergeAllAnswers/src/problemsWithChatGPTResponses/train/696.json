    "problem": "If $2x - y = 5$ and $x + 2y = 5$, what is the value of $x$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "To solve for $x$, we wish to eliminate $y$. Multiply the first equation by $2$ and add it to the second: \\begin{align*}\n(4x-2y) + (x+2y) &= 10+5\\\\\n5x &= 15\\\\\nx &= \\boxed{3}\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "To solve for $x$, we must eliminate $y$ from the given equations.  Multiplying both sides of the first equation by 2 gives us $4x - 2y = 10$.  Because $x+2y=5$, we can subtract the second equation from the first and obtain $3x = 5$. Dividing both sides of the equation $3x = 5$ by 3 gives us $x = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{3}}$."
