    "problem": "If the system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2x-y&=a,\\\\\n3y-6x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has a solution, find $\\frac{a}{b},$ assuming $b \\neq 0.$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If we multiply the first equation by $-3$, we obtain\n\n$$3y-6x=-3a.$$Since we also know that $3y-6x=b$, we have\n\n$$-3a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{3}}.$$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We can see that the first equation is $y=a-2x.$ Substituting this value for $y$ into the second equation gives $3(a-2x)-6x=b.$ Simplifying the lefthand side gives $3a-12x-6x=b.$ Simplifying $3a-18x=b$ yields $18x=3a-b$ or $x=\\frac{3}{18}a-\\frac{b}{18}=\\frac{1}{6}a-\\frac{b}{18}.$ Substituting this expression for $x$ into $y=a-2x$ gives $y=a-2\\left(\\frac{1}{6}a-\\frac{b}{18}\\right)=a-\\frac{1}{3}a+\\frac{b}{9}=\\frac{2}{3}a+\\frac{b}{9}.$ Thus, $\\frac{a}{b}=\\frac{2}{3}.$\n\nNote that this means that any point $(x,y)$ satisfying $2x-y=2$ and $3y-6x=3$ must satisfy the original pair of equations, since the slope of the graph of $2x-y=2$ is $2$ and the slope of the graph of $3y-6x=3$ is $\\frac{1}{2},$ so the two graphs will not coincide in a second point."
