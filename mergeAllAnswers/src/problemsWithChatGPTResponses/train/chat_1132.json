                "content": "We can consider the graphs of the two rules for $f(x)$. For $x > -2$, the graph is a staircase with $f(x)=1$ between $-\\frac{3}{2}<x<-1$, $f(x)=2$ between $-\\frac{4}{3}<x<-\\frac{3}{2}$, and so forth. Similarly, graph for $x < -2$ is a staircase with $f(x)=0$ between $-2<x<-1$, $f(x)=-1$ between $-3<x<-2$.  Since the first rule never gives an integer of 0, and the second rule never gives a positive integer,  the answer is $\\boxed{0}$.",
