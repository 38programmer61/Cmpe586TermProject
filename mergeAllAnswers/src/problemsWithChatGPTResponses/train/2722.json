    "problem": "The sum of two positive integers is 50 and their difference  is 12. What is the value of the positive difference of the squares of the integers?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the two integers $x$ and $y$. Without loss of generality, let $x$ be the larger of the two. We are given that $x+y = 50$ and $x-y = 12$, and we are asked for $x^2 - y^2$. Because $x^2 - y^2$ factors into $(x+y)(x-y)$, we can simply substitute in to get $x^2 - y^2 = 50 \\cdot 12 = \\boxed{600}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the two positive integers be $a$ and $b$, where $a > b$. Since their sum is $50$, we have $a + b = 50$, and since their difference is $12$, we have $a - b = 12$. Adding these equations gives $2a = 62$, so $a = 31$. Then the positive difference of their squares is $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b) = 50 \\cdot 12 = \\boxed{600}$."
