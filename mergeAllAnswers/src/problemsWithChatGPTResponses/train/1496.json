    "problem": "A line contains the points $(6,8)$, $(-2, k)$ and $(-10, 4)$. What is the value of $k$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The slope between the first two points must be the same as the slope between the second two points, because all three points lie on the same line. We thus have the equation $\\dfrac{k-8}{-2-6}=\\dfrac{4-k}{-10-(-2)}.$ Solving for $k$ yields $k=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since the line containing $(6,8)$, $(-2,k)$, and $(-10,4)$ is a straight line, we can find the slope of this line by finding the slope of any two of these three points. Choosing $(6,8)$ and $(-2,k)$ as the two points, we find that the slope is $\\frac{8-k}{6-(-2)}=\\frac{8-k}{8}=\\frac{4-k}{4}$. Since this slope is the same as the slope between the points $(-2,k)$ and $(-10,4)$, the slope of this line is also $\\frac{4-k}{4}$. Setting this equal to the slope between the points $(6,8)$ and $(-10,4)$, we have that $\\frac{4-k}{4}=\\frac{8-4}{6-(-10)}=\\frac{4}{16}$. Algebraic manipulation shows that $\\frac{4-k}{4}=\\frac{4}{16}=\\frac{1}{4}$, so $4-k=4$. Thus, $k=4-4=\\boxed{0}$."
