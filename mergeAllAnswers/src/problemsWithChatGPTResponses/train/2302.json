    "problem": "If $4u-5v=23$ and $2u+4v=-8$, find the value of $u+v$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can begin by multiplying the second equation by two, giving us the following system of equations \\begin{align*} 4u-5v&=23\n\\\\ 4u+8v&=-16\n\\end{align*}From here we simply subtract the second equation from the first. This gives us $(4u-5v)-(4u+8v)=23-(-16)$, which simplifies to $-13v=39$ or $v=-3$. We now know the value of $v$, so we can just plug this into the first equation in order to solve for $u$. This gives us $4u-5(-3)=23$, or $4u=8$ and $u=2$. Since $v=-3$ and $u=2$, $u+v=2+(-3)=\\boxed{-1}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Multiply the first equation by $2$ and double the second equation. We get $8u-10v=46$ and $4u+8v=-16$. Adding these two equations, we find that $12u-2v=30$, so $12u=30+2v\\implies u = \\frac{30+2v}{12}$. To find $u+v$, we plug this value for $u$ into the first equation: \\begin{align*} u+v &= \\frac{30+2v}{12}+v = \\frac{30+2v}{12}+\\frac{12v}{12}\\\\ &= \\frac{30+2v+12v}{12} = \\frac{30+14v}{12} = \\boxed{\\frac{15+7v}{6}}. \\end{align*}"
