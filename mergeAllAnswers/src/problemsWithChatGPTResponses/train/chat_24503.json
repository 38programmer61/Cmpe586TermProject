                "content": "Let the cost of the pen in dollars be $x$. Since the pen costs $\\$1$ more than the ink refill, the cost of the ink refill is $x-1$ dollars. Therefore, we have the equation $x+(x-1)=1.10$. Combining like terms on the left side of the equation gives $2x-1=1.10$. Adding $1$ to both sides of the equation, we have $2x=2.10$. Finally, dividing both sides of the equation by $2$ yields $x=\\boxed{1.05}$.",
