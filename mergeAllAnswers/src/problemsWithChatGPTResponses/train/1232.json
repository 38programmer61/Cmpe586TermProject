    "problem": "In a recent basketball game, Shenille attempted only three-point shots and two-point shots.  She was successful on $20\\%$ of her three-point shots and $30\\%$ of her two-point shots.  Shenille attempted $30$ shots.  How many points did she score?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the number of attempted three-point shots made be $x$ and the number of attempted two-point shots be $y$.  We know that $x+y=30$.   We need to evaluate $(0.2\\cdot3)x +(0.3\\cdot2)y$, as we know that the three-point shots are worth 3 points and that she made $20\\%$ of them and that the two-point shots are worth 2 and that she made $30\\%$ of them.\n\nSimplifying, we see that this is equal to $0.6x + 0.6y = 0.6(x+y)$.  Plugging in $x+y=30$, we get $0.6(30) = \\boxed{18}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let's say Shenille attempted $x$ three-point shots and $30-x$ two-point shots.  She made $0.2x$ three-pointers and $0.3(30-x)$ two-pointers.  In total, she scored $3(0.2x) + 2(0.3(30-x))$ points.  Since she made all of her shots, this adds up to $3(x-y)+2(3-y)$ points, and we want this to equal the total number of points scored, $30$.  Therefore, we have the equation  \\begin{align*}\n3(x-y)+2(3-y) &=30\\\\\n9x-8y &= 24.\n\\end{align*}We were also told that $x+y=30,$ which we can solve for $x$ to get $x=30-y$.  Substituting, we see that $(9(30-y)-8y)=24$.  Simplifying the left side gives $270-17y=24$.  Solving for $y$ gives $y=\\frac{270-24}{17}$, so $y=15.$  Therefore, Shenille made $15$ two-point shots and $30-15=15$ three-point shots, for a total of $2(15)=\\boxed{30}$ points."
