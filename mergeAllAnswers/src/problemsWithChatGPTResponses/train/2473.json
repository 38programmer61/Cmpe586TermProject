    "problem": "Find the ordered pair $(j,k)$ that satisfies the equations $5j-42k=1$ and $2k-j=3$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can multiply the second equation by 5, so that our equations are \\begin{align*}\n5j -42k &=1\\text{, and} \\\\\n-5j +10k &=15. \\end{align*}Summing these equations gives $-32k=16$, so $k=-16/32=-1/2$. We substitute this value for $k$ into one of the equations to solve for $j$: \\begin{align*}\n2\\left(\\frac{-1}{2}\\right)-j&=3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ j &= -4.\n\\end{align*}So the solution is $\\boxed{(-4,-\\frac{1}{2})}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Solving the second equation for $j$, we have $j = 2k-3$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $5(2k-3)-42k=1$, which simplifies to $10k-15-42k=1$. Combining like terms gives $-32k-15=1$, or $-32k = 16$. Dividing both sides by $-32$ gives $k = -\\frac{16}{32}=-\\frac12$. Substituting this into $j = 2k-3$, we have $j=2\\left(-\\frac12\\right)-3=-4-3=-7$. Therefore, the solution is $(j,k)=\\boxed{(-7,-\\frac12)}$."
