                "content": "We could solve this system by multiplying the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $5,$ but notice that we could add these equations directly to get $$(3x-5y)+(7x+2y)=(-11)+(-12).$$Simplifying, we get $10x-3y=-23.$  Subtracting this equation from $2$ times the first equation, we get $$(2)(3x-5y)-(10x-3y)=(2)(-11)-(-23).$$Simplifying, we find $-4y=-1,$ so $y=\\frac14.$\n\nWe have $3x-5y = -11,$ so $3x = -11 + 5y = -11+ 5\\left(\\frac14\\right) = -11 + \\frac54 = -\\frac64 + \\frac54 = -\\frac14.$ Therefore, $x=\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{12}},$ so the solution is $\\left(-\\frac{1}{12},\\frac{1}{4}\\right).$",
