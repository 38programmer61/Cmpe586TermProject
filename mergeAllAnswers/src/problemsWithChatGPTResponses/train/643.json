    "problem": "Billy's age is twice Joe's age and the sum of their ages is 45. How old is Billy?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $B$ and $J$ represent the respective ages of Billy and Joe. We can write the equations $B=2J$ and $B+J=45$. We use the second equation to solve for $J$ in terms of $B$ and get $J=45-B$. Now we plug in this expression for $J$ into the first equation. $$B=2(45-B)=90-2B\\qquad\\Rightarrow 3B=90\\qquad\\Rightarrow B=30$$ So Billy is $\\boxed{30}$ years old.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let's assume Joe's age = x\nBilly's age = 2x  (twice Joe's age)\nSince the sum of their ages is 45, the equation becomes:\nx + 2x = 45\nCombining like terms results in 3x = 45\nDividing both sides by 3 gives x = 15\nTherefore, Billy's age is 2x = 2 * 15 = <<2*15=30>>30\nBilly is 30 years old."
