    "problem": "The equation $x^2+ ax = -14$ has only integer solutions for $x$. If $a$ is a positive integer, what is the greatest possible value of $a$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The left-hand side factors into $x(x+a)=-14$, so $x$ and $x+a$ both divide $-14$. One of the two factors is negative and the other positive, since their product is negative. $x+a>x$, so $x+a>0$ and $x<0$. This leaves 4 possibilities for $x$, since it is negative and divides $-14$ evenly: $-1$, $-2$, $-7$, and $-14$. $x=-1$ gives $x+a=14$ and therefore $a=15$. Similarly, $x=-2$, $x=-7$, and $x=-14$ give $a=9$, $a=9$, and $a=15$, respectively. The largest value for $a$ is thus $\\boxed{15}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "By completing the square, we obtain $(x+a/2)^2 = a^2/4+14$. The left hand side is a square, so the right hand side must be as well. In other words, $a^2/4+14 = m^2$ for some positive integer $m$. Rearranging, $a^2 = 4m^2 - 4 \\cdot 14 = 4(m^2-14)$. Since both sides are even, $a$ must be even, say $a = 2b$ for some positive integer $b$. Substituting, $4b^2 = 4(m^2-14)$, or $b^2 = m^2-14$. By writing $m$ and $b$ as their prime factorizations \\begin{align*}\nm &= p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_r^{e_r}\\\\\nb &= q_1^{f_1}q_2^{f_2}\\cdots q_s^{f_s}\n\\end{align*}and plugging in, we have \\[\\left(q_1^{f_1}q_2^{f_2}\\cdots q_s^{f_s}\\right)^2 = \\left(p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_r^{e_r}\\right)^2 - 14.\\]Since $m \\neq b$, the prime factors of $m^2-14$ are all greater than $1$. The prime factors of $b^2$ are either the $p_i$'s, each with an even exponent, or an extra prime factor of $2$. Thus, the prime factorization of $m^2-14$ contains only prime factors of $m^2-14$. But we can add more factors of $m^2-14$ to the left hand side by inserting factors of $14$ on the right. Therefore, we must have $m^2-14 = 2^{2g+1}\\cdot\\text{odd}^2$ for some positive integer $g$. In other words, $m^2-14$ is $2$ times an odd integer squared. Re-arranging, $2^{2g+1}\\cdot\\text{odd}^2 - 14 = q_1^{f_1}q_2^{f_2}\\cdots q_s^{f_s}$. But the right hand side is even, so the left hand side must be as well. Therefore, $\\text{odd}^2$ must be even, which is only possible if $\\text{odd}$ is even. Write $\\text{odd} = 2d$, so $2^{2g+1}\\cdot (2d)^2 = q_1^{f_1}q_2^{f_2}\\cdots q_s^{f_s} + 14$. Rearranging, $2^{2g+1}d^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(q_1^{f_1}q_2^{f_2}\\cdots q_s^{f_s} + 14\\right)$. The right hand side is an integer, so $4|2d^2$, which implies $2|d$. Write $d=2d'$ for some positive integer $d'$. Substituting, $2^{2g-1}d'^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\left(q_1^{f_1}q_2^{f_2}\\cdots q_s^{f_s} + 14\\right)$. Since both $2^{2g-1}$ and $d'^2$ are integers, the right hand side must be a multiple of $2^{2g-1}$. This requires that $4|\\left(q_1^{f_1}q_2^{f_2}\\cdots q_s^{f_s} + 14\\right)$. This is only possible if $q_1^{f_1}q_2^{f_2}\\cdots q_s^{f_s}$ is a multiple of $4$, which requires at least one of the $f_i$'s to be greater than $1$. But this is impossible since the $q_i$'s are all different primes. Therefore there are no solutions in positive integers $a,b$, so the answer is $\\boxed{0}$."
