    "problem": "The sum of two numbers is $30$.   If we double the larger number, and subtract three times the smaller number, the result is 5.  What is the positive difference between the two numbers?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the smaller integer and $y$ be the larger integer. We have $x+y=30$ and $2y-3x=5$. Solving for $x$ in terms of $y$ using the first equation, we get $x=30-y$. Now we substitute $x$ in terms of $y$ into the second equation. \\begin{align*}\n2y-3(30-y)&=5\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n2y-90+3y&=5\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n5y&=95\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\ny&=19\n\\end{align*} And $x=30-19=11$. The positive difference is $y-x=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We set up a system of equations.  Since we are told that \"The sum of two numbers is $30$,\" we get: \\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 30.\n\\end{align*}We also know that \"If we double the larger number, and subtract three times the smaller number, the result is $5$,\" which we can translate to:\\begin{align*}\n2x - 3y &= 5.\n\\end{align*}We could solve this system by substitution.  From $x + y = 30,$ we have $y = 30 - x.$  Substituting $y = 30 - x$ into the second equation, we get $2x - 3(30 - x) = 5,$ which gives us $x = 23.$  Then $y = 30 - 23 = 7,$ so the positive difference between the two numbers is $23 - 7 = \\boxed{16}.$"
