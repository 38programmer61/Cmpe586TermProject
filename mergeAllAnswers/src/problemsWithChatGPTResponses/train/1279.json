    "problem": "Consider the arithmetic sequence  $1$, $4$, $7$, $10$, $13$, $\\ldots$.  Find the $15^{\\text{th}}$ term in the sequence.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The first term is 1, and the common difference is 3.  Therefore, to get to the $15^\\text{th}$ term, we must add 3 to the first term 14 times, to get $1+ 3(14) = \\boxed{43}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The common difference is $4 - 1 = 7 - 4 = \\dotsb = 10 - 7 = 13 - 10 = 3$, so the $15^{\\text{th}}$ term is $1 + 14 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{43}$."
