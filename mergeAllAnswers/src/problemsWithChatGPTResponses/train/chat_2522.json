                "content": "Consider a geometric series with first term $a$ and common ratio $r$. Recall that the sum of the first $n$ terms of the geometric series is given by the formula $$S_n = \\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}.$$ In this particular series, we have $a=1$ and $r=1/5$. We want to find the sum of the entire series, so we let $n$ approach infinity. Since $|r| < 1$, the term $r^n$ approaches 0 as $n$ becomes arbitrarily large, so we have $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty } S_n = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty } \\frac{1(1-(1/5)^n)}{1-1/5} = \\frac{1(1-0)}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac14}.$$",
