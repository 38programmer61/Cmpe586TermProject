    "problem": "The denominator of a fraction is 7 less than 3 times the numerator.  If the fraction is equivalent to $2/5$, what is the numerator of the fraction?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We let the numerator be $x$, so the denominator is $3x-7$.  Because the fraction equals $2/5$, we have $x/(3x-7) = 2/5$.  Multiplying both sides by $5(3x-7)$ (or cross-multiplying) gives $5x = 2(3x-7)$.  Expanding the right side gives $5x = 6x - 14$.  Subtracting $6x$ from both sides gives $-x = -14$, so we find $x = \\boxed{14}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the numerator of the fraction be $x$. The denominator is then $3x-7$. Since the fraction is equivalent to $\\frac{2}{5}$, $\\frac{x}{3x-7}=\\frac{2}{5}$. Cross-multiplying gives $5x=2(3x-7)$. Expanding the right side gives $5x=6x-14$. Subtracting $5x$ from both sides gives $0=x-14$, so $x=\\boxed{14}$."
