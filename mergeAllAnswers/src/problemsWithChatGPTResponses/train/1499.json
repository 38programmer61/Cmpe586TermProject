    "problem": "Find the largest integer value of $n$ such that $n^2-9n+18$ is negative.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Writing this as an inequality, we get the expression \\begin{align*} n^2-9n+18&<0 \\quad \\Rightarrow\n\\\\ (n-3)(n-6)&<0.\n\\end{align*} Since 3 and 6 are roots of the quadratic, the inequality must change sign at these two points. Thus, we continue by testing the 3 intervals of $n$. For $n<3$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $3<n<6$, only $n-6$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $n>6$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $n$ that satisfy the inequality is $3<n<6$. Since the question asks for the largest integer value of $n$, the answer is the largest integer smaller than 6, which is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let's find the roots of the equation $n^2-9n+18 = 0$. We can do this using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula says that the roots of the equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$ are $x = \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.\n\nIn this case, $a=1$, $b=-9$, and $c=18$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get\n$$n = \\frac{-(-9)\\pm\\sqrt{(-9)^2-4(1)(18)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{9\\pm\\sqrt{81-72}}{2} = \\frac{9\\pm\\sqrt{9}}{2} = \\frac{9\\pm 3}{2}.$$Therefore, $n$ must be either $\\frac{9+3}{2} = 6$ or $\\frac{9-3}{2} = 3$. We can see that $n^2-9n+18$ is positive when $n=3$ and negative when $n=6$, so the largest integer value of $n$ such that $n^2-9n+18$ is negative is $\\boxed{6}$."
