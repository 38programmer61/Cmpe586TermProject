    "problem": "George purchases a sack of apples, a bunch of bananas, a cantaloupe, and a carton of dates for $ \\$ 20$. If a carton of dates costs twice as much as a sack of apples and the price of a cantaloupe is equal to the price of a sack of apples minus a bunch of bananas, how much would it cost George to purchase a bunch of bananas and a cantaloupe?",

    "solution": "Let $a$ denote the price of a sack of apples, $b$ the price of a bunch of bananas, $c$ the price of a cantaloupe, and $d$ the price of a carton of dates. We can express the information given in the problem by the following system of linear equations:  \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d &= 20\\\\\n2a &= d\\\\\na-b &= c\n\\end{align*}\n\nSubstituting into the first equation for $c$ and $d$ gives $a + b + a - b + 2a = 20$, which simplifies to $4a = 20$, so $a = 5$. From here, we use $a$ to find $d = 2 \\cdot 5 = 10$. We put these values into the first equation to get $5 + b + c + 10 = 20$, so $b + c = \\boxed{ \\$ 5}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let $\\text{\\textdollar} a$ be the price of a sack of apples. There are two important equations given in the problem: \\begin{align*}\n0a+0b+0c+2d&=20\\\\\n0a-b+(a-b)&=20\n\\end{align*} The first equation represents the cost of the apples, bananas, cantaloupe, and dates. In this equation, $a$ refers to apples, $b$ refers to bananas, $c$ refers to cantaloupes, and $d$ refers to dates. Since the first equation states that a carton of dates costs twice as much as a sack of apples, we conclude that $2a=20\\Rightarrow a=10$. We now substitute $a=10$ into the second equation and solve for $b$. \\begin{align*}\n0(10)-b&+(10-b)=20\\\\\n0-b+10-b&=20\\\\\n20-2b&=20\\\\\n-2b&=0\\\\\nb&=0\n\\end{align*}Since $b$ refers to bananas, this means that George pays $\\boxed{0}$ to purchase the bananas. Alternatively, we could substitute $a=10$, $b=0$ into the second equation, and solve for $c$: \\begin{align*}\n0(10)-0+(10-b)&=20\\\\\n0+10-b&=20\\\\\n10-b&=20\\\\\n-b&=10\\\\\nb&=-10\n\\end{align*} This answer doesn't make logical sense so we reject it."
