                "content": "Recall that the graph of a parabola opens downward and has a vertex at its highest point. Since $y=-x^2+5$, the graph of this parabola has a maximum value at its vertex. To find the vertex, we can find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex using the formula $x=-\\frac{b}{2a}$, where a and b are the coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$, respectively, in the quadratic function. In this case, the coefficient of $x^2$ is $-1$, and the coefficient of $x$ is $0$, so $x=-\\frac{0}{2(-1)}=0$. Substituting $x=0$ into $y=-x^2+5$, we find that $y=-0^2+5=5$. Therefore, the maximum value of $y$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
