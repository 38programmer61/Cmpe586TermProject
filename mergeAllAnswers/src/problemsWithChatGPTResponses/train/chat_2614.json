Then, the next odd positive integer is 5 (which is 2 more than 3), and so on. Thus, the sequence of the first 10 odd positive integers is: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19. \n\nTo find the sum of these integers, we can add them together using addition: \n\n1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 = 100.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the first 10 odd positive integers is 100.",
