                "content": "Multiplying both sides by $(t-8)(t+5) = t^2 - 3t - 40$, we obtain \\[(t^2-t-56)(t^2-3t-40) = 3(t-8)(t+5).\\]Expanding, we have \\[(t^2-t-56)(t^2-3t-40) - 3(t-8)(t+5) = (t-8)(t+5)(t^2 - 3t - 40 - 3) = 0.\\]Since $t^2 - 3t - 40 - 3 = t^2 - 3t - 43$ is a quadratic, this means $t = 8$ or $t = -5$ or $t = 1.5 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{173}}{2}.$\n\nNote that $t=1.5 + \\frac{\\sqrt{173}}{2}$ is positive, while the \"only\" remaining positive root for $t$ is $t \\approx 9.86.$ This gives us two viable solutions: $\\boxed{8}$ and $\\approx 9.86.$ The value of $\\approx 9.86$ is achieved by a quadratic equation $\\approx 1.75 t^2 - 7.5t - 163.5$ with positive leading coefficient, for which factoring the quadratic equation will yield two positive rational solutions. The quadratic equation in question can be computed by dividing $(t^2-t-56)(t^2-3t-40) - 3(t-8)(t+5)$ by $t-8.$ Indeed, this might come to an astonishment, for quite often equations given tend to be of some nicely fitting form that allows factoring, but not always must there necessarily be such nice form. In fact, there is a common trap exhibiting similar pattern which one can easily fall in if not careful.",
