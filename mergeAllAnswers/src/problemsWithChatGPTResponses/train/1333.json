    "solution": "When using the distributive property for the first time, we add the product of $x+2$ and $x$ to the product of $x+2$ and 5:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(x+2)(x+5) &= (x+2) \\cdot x + (x+2) \\cdot 5\\\\\n&= x(x+2) + 5(x+2)\n\\end{align*}We use the distributive property again and combine like terms:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx(x+2) + 5(x+2) &= x^2 + 2x + 5x+ 10\\\\\n&= \\boxed{x^2 + 7x + 10}\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "To expand the product ${(x+2)(x+5)}$, we can use the distributive property. We multiply each term in the first factor, $x+2$, by each term in the second factor, $x+5$, and then combine like terms.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$(x+2)(x+5) = x(x+5) + 2(x+5)$\n\nExpanding further, we multiply each term in the first term of the product, $x$, by each term in the second factor, $x+5$, and then combine like terms:\n\n$= x(x) + x(5) + 2(x+5)$\n\n$= x^2 + 5x + 2(x+5)$\n\nExpanding again, we multiply each term in the second term of the product, $2$, by each term in the second factor, $x+5$, and then combine like terms:\n\n$= x^2 + 5x + 2x + 10$\n\nFinally, we combine like terms:\n\n$= x^2 + (5x + 2x) + 10$\n\n$= x^2 + 7x + 10$\n\nTherefore, the expanded form of the product ${(x+2)(x+5)}$ is $x^2 + 7x + 10$."
