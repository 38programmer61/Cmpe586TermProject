                "content": "We look at the equation $ \\left| \\frac{12}{x} + 3\\right| = 2 $ in two cases: $\\frac{12}{x} + 3$ is positive or zero, and when it is negative. First assume $\\frac{12}{x} + 3$ is positive or zero. Then \\[\n\\frac{12}{x} + 3 = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{12}{x} = -1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -12.\n\\]Now assume $\\frac{12}{x} + 3$ is negative. Then \\[\n- \\left( \\frac{12}{x} + 3 \\right) = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{12}{x} = -5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x= -\\frac{12}{5}.\n\\]Since the problem is asking for the product of all possible values of $x$, we multiply our two solutions together. We have $$-12 \\times \\left(- \\frac{12}{5}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{144}{5}}.$$(Notice that each of our two cases is slightly redundant, since $\\frac{12}{x} + 3$ can't be both positive/nonzero and negative. However, they both yield the solution $x = -12$, and since we are asked for the product of \\textit{all} solutions, we include $-12$ twice.",
