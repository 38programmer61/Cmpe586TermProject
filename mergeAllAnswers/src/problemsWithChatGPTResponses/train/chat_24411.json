Since the common difference between consecutive terms is $d$, the second term is $a_1 + d$, the third term is $a_1 + 2d$, etc.  Therefore, we can write the thirteenth term as\n\\[a_1 + 12d.\\]Since the first term is $\\frac{7}{9}$, we have\n\\[\\frac{7}{9} + 12d = \\frac{4}{5}.\\]Isolating $d$, we find $d = \\frac{1}{36}$.  Therefore, the seventh term is\n\\[\\frac{7}{9} + 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{36} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\]+",
