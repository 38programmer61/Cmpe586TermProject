    "solution": "Expanding the product on the right, we have $x^2 + 4x + 3 = -(x^2 + 8x + 15),$ so $x^2 + 4x + 3 + (x^2 + 8x + 15) = 0$.  Simplifying the left side gives $2x^2 + 12x + 18 = 0.$ Dividing by 2, we have $x^2 + 6x + 9 = 0$, so $(x + 3)(x + 3) = 0.$ The only solution for $x$ is $\\boxed{-3}.$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "First, we can expand the right side: \\begin{align*}\n-(x + 3)(x + 5) &= -x(x + 5) - 3(x + 5) \\\\\n&= -x^2 - 5x - 3x - 15 \\\\\n&= -x^2 - 8x - 15.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, we have \\[x^2 + 4x + 3 = -x^2 - 8x - 15.\\]Adding $x^2 + 8x + 15$ to both sides gives $2x^2 + 12x + 18 = 0.$ Then, dividing by 2 gives \\[x^2 + 6x + 9 = 0,\\]which factors as $(x + 3)(x + 3) = 0.$ Hence, the only solution is $x = \\boxed{-3}.$"
