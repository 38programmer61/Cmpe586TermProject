    "problem": "A geometric sequence starts $16$, $-24$, $36$, $-54$. What is the common ratio of this sequence?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The common ratio is $(-24)/16 = \\boxed{-\\frac{3}{2}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Dividing successive terms in the sequence, we see that $\\frac{-24}{16} = \\frac{36}{-24} = \\frac{-54}{36} = \\boxed{-\\frac{3}{2}}$."
