                "content": "Let the length and width of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$ respectively. We are given that $2l+2w=30$, or $l+w=15$, which tells us that $w=15-l$. We wish to maximize the area, which is $lw$. Substituting $w=15-l$, we have that $A=l(15-l)=-l^2+15l$. Completing the square, we have $A=-l^2+15l=-l^2+15l-\\frac{15^2}{4}+\\frac{15^2}{4}=-\\left(l-\\frac{15}{2}\\right)^2+\\frac{15^2}{4}=-\\left(l-\\frac{15}{2}\\right)^2+112.5$. Since $-\\left(l-\\frac{15}{2}\\right)^2$ is always nonpositive, it is maximized when it equals 0, which occurs when $l=\\frac{15}{2}$. Thus, the maximum possible area is $A=112.5$. The answer is $\\boxed{112.5}$.",
