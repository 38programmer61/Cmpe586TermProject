    "problem": "A recent study found that 60$\\%$ of men and 80$\\%$ of women surveyed support increased funding for particular medical research. The study surveyed 100 men and 900 women. What was the overall percent of the people surveyed who supported increased funding?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "$60\\%$ of $100$ men is $60$ people.\n\n$80\\%$ of $900$ women is $720$ people.\n\nSo out of $1000$ total people surveyed, $780$ are supportive.  This is $\\boxed{78\\%}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Out of the 100 men surveyed, 60% support increased funding, which is $0.60 \\cdot 100 = 60$ men.\nOut of the 900 women surveyed, 80% support increased funding, which is $0.80 \\cdot 900 = 720$ women.\nSo a total of $60 + 720 = 780$ people support increased funding out of the $100 + 900 = 1000$ people surveyed.\nTherefore, the overall percent who supported increased funding is $ \\frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 = \\boxed{78\\%}$."
