    "problem": "The equation $x^2+12x=73$ has two solutions. The positive solution has the form $\\sqrt{a}-b$ for positive natural numbers $a$ and $b$. What is $a+b$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Completing the square, we add $(12/2)^2=36$ to both sides of the equation to get $x^2+12x+36=109 \\Rightarrow (x+6)^2=109$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x+6=\\sqrt{109}$ (we take the positive square root because we want the positive solution), or $x=\\sqrt{109}-6$. Thus, $a=109$ and $b=6$, so $a+b=\\boxed{115}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since we want $\\sqrt{a}-b$ to be positive, it must be the positive root of the given equation of a quadratic. By moving the $73$ to the left side of the equation, we have $x^2+12x-73 = 0$. We want to make this equation into the form $(x - \\sqrt{a}+b)(x - \\sqrt{a}-b) = 0$. Since the coefficient of $x^2$ is $1$, we know that $x=\\sqrt{a}+b -(\\sqrt{a}-b)=2b$. Since $2b = -12 \\Longrightarrow b = -6$, we can substitute to get $-12 = \\sqrt{a} + -6 \\Longrightarrow \\sqrt{a} = -6 - -12 = 6$, so $a = 36$. Thus $a+b=36+6=\\boxed{42}$."
