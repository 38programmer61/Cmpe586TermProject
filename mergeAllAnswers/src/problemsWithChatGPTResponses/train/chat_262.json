                "content": "Let x and y be the positive integers that Mr. Sanchez's students were asked to add.\nIf Juan mistakenly subtracted instead of adding, the equation would be: x - y = 2. (Equation 1)\nIf Maria mistakenly multiplied instead of adding, the equation would be: x * y = 120. (Equation 2)\nFrom equation 1, we can solve for x = y + 2 and substitute into equation 2.\n(y + 2) * y = 120\ny^2 + 2y - 120 = 0\nSolving this quadratic equation, we find two possible values for y: y = 10 or y = -12. Since we are looking for positive integers, y = 10.\nSubstituting y = 10 back into the equation x = y + 2, we find x = 10 + 2 = 12.\nTherefore, the correct answer is 12 + 10 = 22. Answer: \\boxed{22}.",
