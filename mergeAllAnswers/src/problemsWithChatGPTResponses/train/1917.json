    "problem": "The sum of three numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ is 99. If we increase $a$ by 6, decrease $b$ by 6 and multiply $c$ by 5, the three resulting numbers are equal. What is the value of $b$?",

    "solution": "We are given the equations $a+b+c=99$ and $a+6=b-6=5c$.  Solve $b-6=5c$ for $b$ to find $b=5c+6$, and solve $5c=a+6$ for $a$ to find $a=5c-6$.  Substituting both of these equations into $a+b+c=99$, we have $(5c-6)+(5c+6)+c=99$.  Simplifying the left hand side, we get $11c=99$ which implies $c=9$.  Substituting into $b=5c+6$, we have $b=5(9)+6=\\boxed{51}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "So, we have three original numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ whose sum is 99, and the three resulting numbers are equal.\n\nLet $x$ be the common value of $a+6$, $b-6$, and $5c$. From here, $a+6=x$, $b-6=x$, and $5c=x$. Since the three original numbers sum to 99, we have $a+b+c=99$. Now, we can express $x$ in terms of $a$ (since $a+6=x$, we have $a=x-6$), substitute that expression into the equation $a+b+c=99$ and substitute the values of $a$ and $x$, and solve for $b$.\n\nSubstituting $a=x-6$, we get $(x-6)+b+c=99$. Substituting the value of $x$ in terms of $a$ and $c$ (from before), $b+c=99$. Using the third equality, $5c=x$, we have $b+5c=99$. Rewriting $b+c$ as $(b+5c)-4c$, we get $99=(x-6)-4c$. Solving this equation gives $x=105-4c$.\n\nSince $a+6=x$, $a+6=105-4c$. Solving for $a$ gives $a=99-4c$. Since $a+6=x$, $99-4c+6=105-4c=x$. Thus, $x=105-4c$. Now we need to solve for $b$.\n\nSince $b=x+6$, $b=105-4c+6=111-4c$. We can substitute this value of $b$ into the equation $5c=x$, since we know $x=105-4c$, and solve for $c$.\n\nSubstituting, we have $5c=105-4c$. Solving, we get $9c=105$, so $c=105/9=35/3$. Thus, $b=111-4(35/3)=111-140/3=333/3-140/3=\\boxed{\\frac{193}{3}}$."
