                "content": "The discriminant of the quadratic is $b^2 - 4ac$, so we require that $b^2 - 4ac = 0$.  We are given that $b = c + 1$, so $c^2 + 2c + 1 = 4ac$.  Rearranging, we get $4ac - c^2 - 2c - 1 = 0$.  We can factor this as\n\\[(2a - 1)(2c - 3) = 4.\\]Since $c$ is real, we must have $2a - 1$ and $2c - 3$ have the same sign.\n\nIf $2a - 1 > 0,$ then $2c - 3 > 0,$ so $2a - 1 = 2c - 3 = 2.$  Then $2ab = 1$ and $a + b = \\frac{4}{2} = 2,$ so $a = 1$ and $b = 1,$ which does not work.\n\nIf $2a - 1 < 0,$ then $2c - 3 < 0,$ so $2a - 1 = 2c - 3 = -2.$  Then $2ab = -1$ and $a + b = \\frac{-4}{-2} = 2,$ so $a = 1$ and $b = 1.$  Then the polynomial is $x^2 + x + 1,$ which has no real roots.\n\nThus, no real $c$ works, so no real roots are possible.  Hence, the product of all possible values of $c$ is $\\boxed{1}.$",
