                "content": "Let's call the larger number x and the smaller number y. We can set up a system of equations to represent the given information: \n\nx - y = 3  [The difference between x and y is 3]\nx + y = 31  [The sum of x and y is 31]\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by addition or substitution. However, in this case, we can simply add the two equations together to eliminate y:\n\n(x - y) + (x + y) = 3 + 31\n2x = 34\n\nDivide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:\n\nx = 34/2\nx = 17\n\nTherefore, the larger of the two numbers is 17.",
