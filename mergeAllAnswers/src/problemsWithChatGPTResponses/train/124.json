    "problem": "The expression $x^2 - 16x + 60$ can be written in the form $(x - a)(x - b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are both nonnegative integers and $a > b$. What is the value of $3b - a$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Factoring, we have $x^2 - 16x + 60 = (x - 10)(x - 6)$ Therefore, $a = 10$ and $b = 6,$ and $3b - a = 18 - 10 = \\boxed{8}.$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "To express $x^2 - 16x + 60$ as $(x-a)(x-b)$, we check that $(x-6)(x-10)=x^2-16x + 60$. In this case, $6 > 3$, so we have $3b - a = 3\\cdot 6 - 10 = \\boxed{8}$."
