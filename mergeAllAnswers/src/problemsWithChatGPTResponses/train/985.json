    "problem": "If $f(x)=\\frac{x+4}{x^2+ax+b}$, and $f(x)$ has two vertical asymptotes at $x=1$ and $x=-2$, find the sum of $a$ and $b$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that a rational function will have vertical asymptotes at values of $x$ for which $f(x)$ is undefined. Additionally, we know that $f(x)$ is undefined when the denominator of the fraction is equal to zero. Since there are vertical asymptotes at $x=1$ and $x=-2$, the function must be undefined at these two values. Therefore, $(x-1)(x+2)=x^2+ax+b=0 \\Rightarrow x^2+x-2=x^2+ax+b$. So $a=1$ and $b=-2$, and $a+b=1+(-2)=\\boxed{-1}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since $f(x)$ has a vertical asymptote at $x=1$, then $x=1$ must be a root of $x^2+ax+b=0$. This gives us $(x-1)(x^2+ax+b)=x^3+(a-1)x^2+(b-a)x+b=0$. Therefore, $a-1=0$ and $b=0$. Since $f(x)$ also has an asymptote at $x=-2$, $x=-2$ must be the other root of $x^2+ax+b=0$. This means $(-2)^2+a(-2)=0\\Rightarrow 4-2a=0\\Rightarrow a=2$. Finally, we want $a+b+1=\\boxed{3}$."
