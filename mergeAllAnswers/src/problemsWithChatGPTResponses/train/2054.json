    "problem": "Find $x$ such that $\\log_x 4=\\log_{27} 3$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We begin by evaluating the RHS of the equation. Since $27=3^3$, we know that $27^{\\frac13}=3$ and $\\log_{27} 3=\\frac13$. This allows us to simplify the original equation as $\\log_x 4=\\frac13$. Writing this equation in exponential form, we get $x^{\\frac13}=4$, which gives us the solution $x=4^3=\\boxed{64}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Writing both sides of the equation $\\log_x 4=\\log_{27} 3$ with a common logarithm base, we obtain $\\frac{\\log 4}{\\log x} = \\frac{\\log 3}{\\log 27} = \\frac{1}{\\log 3 - \\log 9}$. Cross-multiplying gives $$\\log x = \\frac{\\log 4}{\\log 3 - \\log 9}.$$If we let $r = \\log 3$, then, by the properties of logarithms, $\\log 9 = \\log(3^2) = 2 \\log 3 = 2r$, so $\\frac{1}{\\log 3 - \\log 9} = \\frac{1}{r - 2r} = -\\frac{1}{r}$.  Substituting for $\\frac{\\log 4}{\\log 3 - \\log 9}$ in the equation above, we get $$\\log x = -\\frac{\\log 4}{\\log 3} = -\\log_3 4,$$from which $x = 3^{-\\log_3 4} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$."
