    "problem": "A chess team has $26$ members. However, only $16$ members attended the last meeting: half of the girls attended but all of the boys attended. How many boys are on the chess team?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let there be $B$ boys and $G$ girls. Since every member is either a boy or a girl, $B+G=26$. Also, we have $\\frac{1}{2}G+B=16$. Multiplying the second equation by $2$, we get $G+2B=32$. Subtracting the first equation from this, we get $B=32-26=6$.\n\nThus there are $\\boxed{6}$ boys on the chess team.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We let $g$ be the number of girls on the chess team, so $b+g=26$. Since half of the girls attended the meeting, there were $g/2$ girls present, and since all of the boys attended, there were $b$ boys present. Since $16$ members attended the meeting, $b+g/2=16$. Substituting $g=26-b$ into this equation to eliminate $g$ gives $b+(26-b)/2=16.$ Multiplying both sides by $2$ and simplifying gives $2b+26-b=32.$ Subtracting $26$ from both sides gives $b=6$. There are $\\boxed{6}$ boys on the chess team."
