    "problem": "The product of two positive integers plus their sum is 95. The integers are relatively prime, and each is less than 20. What is the sum of the two integers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let our numbers be $a$ and $b$ with $a>b.$ Then $ab+a+b=95$. With Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick in mind, we add $1$ to both sides and get $ab+a+b+1 = 96$, which factors as $(a+1)(b+1)=96$. We consider pairs $(a+1, b+1)$ of factors of $96$: $(96,1), (48,2), (32,3), (24,4), (16,6), \\text{and} (12,8)$. Since $a<20$, we can rule out the first 4 pairs. The pair $(16,6)$ gives us $a=15, b=5$ which doesn't work because $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, so we are left with the last pair, which gives $a=11$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\\boxed{18}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the two integers be $x$ and $y$. The problem states $xy + x + y = 95$. Factoring we have $(x+1)(y+1)=96$. The prime factorization of $96$ is $2^5\\cdot3$. Since $x$ and $y$ are less than $20$, $x+1$ and $y+1$ must be among the following pairs of factors: $(1,96),(2,48),(3,32),(4,24),(6,16),(8,12),(16,6),(12,8),(24,4),(32,3),(48,2),(96,1)$. Testing all of these we find that $(x,y)=(5,4),(23,1)$. The problem states that $x$ and $y$ are less than $20$, so $(x,y)=(5,4)$. The sum of the two integers is $\\boxed{9}$."
