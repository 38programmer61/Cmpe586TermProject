                "content": "The sum of the first 20 positive even integers is $2+4+6+\\cdots + 38 + 40$. The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(1+20)\\left(\\frac{2+40}{2}\\right) = 10\\cdot 21 = 210$. Similarly, the sum of the first $n$ positive odd integers is $n^2$, so the sum of the first 15 positive odd integers is $1^2+3^2+\\cdots + 29^2 + 31^2 = 15^2 = 225$. The positive difference between these two sums is $225 - 210=\\boxed{15}$.",
