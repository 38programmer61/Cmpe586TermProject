                "content": "To find the slope of a line, we can put the equation of the line into slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line.\n\nRearranging the given equation $2x - 4y = 9$ to slope-intercept form, we subtract $2x$ from both sides of the equation and divide by $-4$ to get \\[y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{9}{4}.\\]Thus, a line with an equation of the form $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + b$ will be parallel to $2x - 4y = 9$. Therefore, the slope of a line parallel to $2x - 4y = 9$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
