    "problem": "To calculate $31^2$, Emily mentally figures the value $30^2$ and adds 61. Emily subtracts a number from $30^2$ to calculate $29^2$. What number does she subtract?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We see that $29^2 = (30 - 1)^2 = 30^2 - 2\\cdot 30 \\cdot 1 +1 = 30^2 - 59$. Therefore, Emily subtracts $\\boxed{59}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Writing $31^2$ as $(30+1)^2=30^2 + 2 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 1 + 1^2$, and excluding the middle term of $30^2 + 61$, we find $31^2 = 30^2 + 1^2$. There is one number subtracted here, $2 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 1 = \\boxed{60}$."
