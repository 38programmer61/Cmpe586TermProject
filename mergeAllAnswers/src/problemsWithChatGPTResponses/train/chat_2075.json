                "content": "Moving all terms to the left-hand side, we have $2x^2+8x+6\\le0$. Factoring the quadratic gives $(2x+2)(x+3)\\le0$. The sign of the expression $(2x+2)(x+3)$ is determined by the sign of each factor. Setting each factor equal to zero gives $x=-1$ and $x=-3$. Since the leading coefficient is $2$ (which is positive), the graph opens upwards and the expression is negative between the zeros. Thus, $(2x+2)(x+3)\\le0$ when $-3\\le x\\le -1$. Written in interval notation, this is $\\boxed{[-3,-1]}$.",
