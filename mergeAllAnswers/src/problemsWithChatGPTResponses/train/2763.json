    "problem": "The second and fifth terms of an arithmetic sequence are 17 and 19, respectively. What is the eighth term?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be $a$, and let the common difference be $d$.  Then the second term is $a + d = 17$, fifth term is $a + 4d = 19$, and the eighth term is $a + 7d$.  Note that $(a + 4d) - (a + d) = 3d$, and $(a + 7d) - (a + 4d) = 3d$, so the terms $a + d = 17$, $a + 4d = 19$, and $a + 7d$ also form an arithmetic sequence.\n\nIf 17 and 19 are consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence, then the common difference is $19 - 17 = 2$, so the next term must be $19 + 2 = \\boxed{21}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the first term be $a$, and let the common difference be $d$. Then our arithmetic sequence is $a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, \\dots$ The second term of the sequence is $a + d$, and the fifth term is $a + 4d$. We are given that $a + d = 17$ and $a + 4d = 19$. We want to find $a + 7d$, which is the eighth term of the sequence. Note that $a + 4d - (a+d) = 3d = 19 - 17 = 2$, so $d = \\dfrac{2}{3}$. Then $a + 7d = a + \\dfrac{14}{3} = \\dfrac{3a}{3} + \\dfrac{14}{3} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}$."
