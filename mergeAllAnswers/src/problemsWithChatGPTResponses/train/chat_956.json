                "content": "Let the two consecutive integers be $n$ and $n+1$. We are given that $n(n+1)<400$. Expanding, we find that $n^2+n<400$. Rearranging, we have $n^2+n-400<0$, or $n^2+n-400=0$. Factoring, we have $(n-20)(n+20)<0$. Since the two consecutive integers must have opposite sign, we know that $n-20$ must be negative and $n+20$ must be positive. So, $-20<n<20$. The greatest possible value of $n$ is $n=19$. The sum of the two consecutive integers is $19+20=\\boxed{39}$.",
