    "problem": "One endpoint of a line segment is $(4,3)$ and its midpoint is $(2,9)$. What is the sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the other endpoint be $(x, y)$. We know that $\\frac{4 + x}{2} + \\frac{3 + y}{2} = 2 + 9 = 11$. Thus, $7 + x + y = 22$, and $x + y = \\boxed{15}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the other endpoint be $(x,y)$. We are given that the midpoint of the segment is $(2,9)$, so the midpoint's coordinates are the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of the endpoint. Therefore, we have the system of equations  \\[\\begin{alignedat}{6} &&x &=& \\frac{1}{2} (4)\\\\ &&y &=& \\frac{1}{2} (3 + 2(9))\\\\ \\\\[-2.5ex] \\implies\\hspace{8pt}&& x &=& 2 \\\\ &&y &=& 10 \\end{alignedat}\\]The sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint is $x+y = 2+10 = \\boxed{12}$."
