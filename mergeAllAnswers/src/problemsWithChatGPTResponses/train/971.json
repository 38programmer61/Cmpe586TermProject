    "problem": "What is the coefficient of $x^2$ when $-5x^3 - 5x^2 - 7x + 1$ is multiplied by $-x^2 - 6x + 1$ and the like terms are combined?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Instead of expanding the entire product, we can look only at terms that will multiply to give $x^2$.  We know that: $$x^2=x^2\\cdot 1=x\\cdot x=1\\cdot x^2$$Knowing this, the $x^2$ term in the expansion will be the sum of these three terms: $$(-5x^2)(1)+(-7x)(-6x)+(1)(-x^2)$$Simplifying gives: \\begin{align*}\n(-5x^2)(1)+(-7x)(-6x)+(1)(-x^2)&=-5x^2+42x^2-x^2\\\\\n&=\\boxed{36}x^2\n\\end{align*}Consequently, the desired coefficient is $\\boxed{36}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We multiply the polynomials out term by term, making sure to combine like terms: \\begin{align*}\n(-5x^3 - 5x^2 - 7x + 1)(-x^2 - 6x + 1)&=(-5x^3)(-x^2) + (-5x^3)(-6x) + (-5x^3)(1) \\\\\n&\\quad+ (-5x^2)(-x^2) + (-5x^2)(-6x) + (-5x^2)(1) \\\\\n&\\quad+ (-7x)(-x^2) + (-7x)(-6x) + (-7x)(1) \\\\\n&\\quad+ (1)(-x^2) + (1)(-6x) + (1)(1).\n\\end{align*}For the coefficient of $x^2$ to be nonzero, we see we must have $(-5x^3)(-x^2)$ and $(1)(-x^2)$ as the only terms on the RHS that involve $x^2$. Hence, the coefficient of $x^2$ is $5 \\cdot 1 + 1 = \\boxed{6}$."
