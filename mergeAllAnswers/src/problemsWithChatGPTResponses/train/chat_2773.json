                "content": "First we can rewrite $16$ as $4^2$ so that the equation now reads $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{2x+8} = (4^2)^{2x+5}$. We can use the rule $a^{bc} = (a^b)^c$ to rewrite this as $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{2x+8} = 4^{4x+10}$. This can be written as $\\frac{1}{4^{2x+8}}= \\frac{4^{4x+10}}{1}$. Next, we can rewrite $\\frac{4^{4x+10}}{1}$ as $4^{4x+10}$. This will allow us to combine the left side with the right side. So the equation is now $\\frac{1}{4^{2x+8}}= 4^{4x+10}$. Since the bases of the two fractions are equal, the exponents must also be equal, so $2x+8 = 4x+10$.  Subtracting $2x$ and $10$ from each side gives $-2 = 2x$, so $x = \\boxed{-1}$.",
