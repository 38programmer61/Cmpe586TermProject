                "content": "Let Marika's age on her $8^{\\text{th}}$ birthday be $m$ and her father's age be $f$. We are told $f=4m$. We also know that Marika's age is increasing linearly with time, while her father's age is increasing linearly with time, but with a greater slope. This means that the time when Marika's father will say, ''My age is now three times your age,'' on Marika's birthday will be one year after Marika's age is three times her current age.\n\nLet $n$ be the number of years that have passed since Marika's $8^{\\text{th}}$ birthday. At that time, Marika's age is $m+n$ and her father's age is $f+n$. Therefore, we are interested in the smallest $n$ such that \\begin{align*}\nf+n&=3(m+n)\\\\\n4m+n&=3m+3n\\\\\nm&=2n.\n\\end{align*}We want to find the smallest multiple of 2 that is greater than 8, since 8 is Marika's age on her $8^{\\text{th}}$ birthday. Checking 10, 12, 14, and 16, we find that 10 is the smallest such number. Therefore, $m=10$, and $10+8=\\boxed{18}$.\n\nTo be more rigorous about why we need to check 10, 12, 14, etc., note that we want the smallest multiple of 2 greater than 8, but all the numbers from 0 to 8 contribute nonnegative multiples of 2, so we check all the numbers from $8+2=10$ on up.",
