    "problem": "What is the value of $x$ if $|x-1| = |x-2|$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The equation implies that either \\[\nx-1 = x-2\\]or \\[ x-1 = -(x-2).\\]The first equation has no solution; the second equation has solution $x= \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The equation $|x - 1| = |x - 2|$ has two cases: $x - 1 = x - 2$ and $x - 1 = 2 - x$. In the first case, $x - 1 = x - 2 \\Rightarrow 1 = 2$, which is false. However, in the second case, $x - 1 = 2 - x$. Adding $x$ and $1$ to both sides gives $2x - 1 = 2$, so $2x = 3$ and $x = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$."
