    "problem": "Find the $r$ that satisfies $\\log_{16} (r+16) = \\frac{5}{4}$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Writing the equation $\\log_{16} (r+16) = \\frac{5}{4}$ in exponential notation gives $r+16 = 16^{\\frac{5}{4}} = (2^4)^{\\frac{5}{4}} = 2^5 = 32$. Solving $r+16 = 32$ gives $r = \\boxed{16}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Writing the left-hand side with an exponent of $16$, we have $(r+16)^{\\frac{1}{4}} = 16^{\\frac{5}{4}}$.  Since the fourth power and fourth root \"undo\" each other, $r+16=16^5 = 2^{20}$.  Therefore, $r=2^{20}-16$. To find a numerical approximation, we can use the fact that $2^{10} = 1024$, so $r=1024^2 - 16 = 1048576 - 16 = \\boxed{1048560}$."
