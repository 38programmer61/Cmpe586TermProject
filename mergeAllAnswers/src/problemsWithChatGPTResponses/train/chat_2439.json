                "content": "First, we find that $1$ green ball is equivalent to $2$ blue balls. Therefore, $4$ green balls are equivalent to $8$ blue balls. $2$ yellow balls are equivalent to $5$ blue balls, while $2$ white balls are equivalent to $\\frac{8}{6}\\cdot4=\\frac{32}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot4=\\frac{16}{6}\\cdot10=\\frac{80}{6}=13\\frac{2}{3}$ blue balls. \n\nThus, $2$ yellow and $2$ white balls are equivalent to $\\frac{80}{6}+\\frac{80}{6}=26\\frac{1}{3}$ blue balls. Therefore, in the final configuration, the weight of the balls is equal to $8+26\\frac{1}{3}=34\\frac{1}{3}$ \"blue balls.\"\n\nOne can be sure that the number $34\\frac{1}{3}$ is equal to $34.\\overline3$ because $0.\\overline1= \\frac19$. So if we multiply by $3$ we will get a fraction with $\\frac13$ and they will cancel out leaving a power of 10 with a value $3$ bigger than the starting number.\n\nIf we know the weight of the balls then we can say blue balls in place of $34\\frac13$. Since this doesn't seem reasonable, the answer is $\\boxed{35}$ blue balls.",
