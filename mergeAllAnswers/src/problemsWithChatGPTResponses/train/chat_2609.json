There is then a $20\\%$ discount off of the $\\$21.00$ which comes to $\\$4.20$. The total price after discounts is $\\$21.00-4.20=\\$16.80$.\nOn the other hand, if the shopper first takes the $20\\%$ discount, the price off the bat will be $20\\% \\cdot \\$25 = \\$5.00$ off, for a price of $\\$25-\\$5.00 = \\$20.00$. There is then a $\\$4.00$ discount on the $\\$20.00$, and the total price after discounts is $\\$20.00-\\$4.00 = \\$16.00$.\nThe clever shopper has saved an extra $\\$16.80 - \\$16.00 = \\$\\boxed{80}$ cents by taking the better valued approach.",
