    "problem": "The operation $*$ is defined for non-zero integers as follows: $a * b = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b}$. If $a+b = 9$ and $ a \\times b = 20$, what is the value of $a*b$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Note that $a * b = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{a + b}{ab}$. We are given that $a + b = 9$ and $ab = 20$. If we substitute these values into $\\frac{a + b}{ab}$, we can see that $a * b = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{20}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Squaring the equation $a + b = 9$ gives us $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 81$.  Multiplying the equation $a \\times b = 20$ by 2 and subtracting this from the equation $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 81$ gives us $a^2 - 2ab + b^2= 0$; thus $(a-b)^2 = 0$ and $a = b$.  We can solve for $a$ and $b$ by substituting this into $a + b = 9$, giving $2a = 9$ so $a= \\frac{9}{2}$ and $b = \\frac 92$. Therefore $a*b = \\boxed{\\frac{81}{4}}$."
