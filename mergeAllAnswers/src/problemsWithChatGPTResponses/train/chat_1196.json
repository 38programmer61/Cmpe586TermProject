                "content": "The expression is not defined when the denominator is equal to 0. To find when the denominator $x^2-20x+100$ is equal to 0, we can find when the quadratic equation $x^2-20x+100=0$ has solutions. This quadratic will have solutions when its discriminant, $b^2-4ac$, is non-negative. In this case, the discriminant is $(-20)^2 - 4(1)(100) = 400 - 400 = 0$. Since the discriminant is 0, the quadratic equation $x^2-20x+100=0$ has one solution. Thus, the expression $\\frac{2x^3+3}{x^2-20x+100}$ is not defined when $x^2-20x+100=0$, which is true when $x = \\boxed{10}$.",
