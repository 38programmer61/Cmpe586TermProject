                "content": "We set up a system of equations.  Since we are told that \"The sum of two numbers is $30$,\" we get: \\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 30.\n\\end{align*}We also know that \"If we double the larger number, and subtract three times the smaller number, the result is $5$,\" which we can translate to:\\begin{align*}\n2x - 3y &= 5.\n\\end{align*}We could solve this system by substitution.  From $x + y = 30,$ we have $y = 30 - x.$  Substituting $y = 30 - x$ into the second equation, we get $2x - 3(30 - x) = 5,$ which gives us $x = 23.$  Then $y = 30 - 23 = 7,$ so the positive difference between the two numbers is $23 - 7 = \\boxed{16}.$",
