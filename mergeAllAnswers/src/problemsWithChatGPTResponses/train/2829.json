    "problem": "Samson derives utility according the relation  $$\\text{Utility} = \\text{hours of math done} \\times \\text{hours of frisbee played}.$$On Monday he plays $t$ hours of frisbee and spends $8 - t$ hours doing math.  On Tuesday, he ends up getting the same amount of utility as Monday while spending $2-t$ hours playing frisbee and $t+3$ hours on math.  Find $t$.  Answer as a fraction in lowest terms.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since he derived equal utility from both days, we have $$t (8 - t) = (2 - t)(t + 3),$$so $$8t - t^2 = -t^2 -t + 6.$$Simplifying gives $t = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Plugging in gives \\begin{align*}\n\\text{Mon} & \\implies (8-t)t. \\\\\n\\text{Tues} & \\implies (2-t)(t+3).\n\\end{align*}Expanding the Tues expression and adding $-t^2-6t+6t+18$, we get \\begin{align*}\n\\text{Tues } = 6 &= 8t+6 \\\\\n6 &= 8t \\\\\n\\frac{3}{4} &= t. \\\\\n\\end{align*}"
