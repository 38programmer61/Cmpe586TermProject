    "problem": "What is the absolute value of the difference between the squares of 101 and 99?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "$101^2>99^2$, so $|101^2-99^2|=101^2-99^2$. This factors as a difference of squares into $(101-99)(101+99)=2\\cdot200=\\boxed{400}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The square of 101 is $101^2 = 10201$, and the square of 99 is $99^2 = 9801$, so the difference between the squares is $10201 - 9801 = 400$. The absolute value of 400 is $\\boxed{400}$."
