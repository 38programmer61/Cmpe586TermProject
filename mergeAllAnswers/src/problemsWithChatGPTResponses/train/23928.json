    "problem": "Marcelle and Jaclyn each think of a polynomial.  Each of their polynomials is monic, has degree 4, and has the same positive constant term and the same coefficient of $z$. The product of their polynomials is \\[z^8 +3z^7 +z^6 +3z^5 +4z^4 +6z^3 +2z^2 +4.\\]What  is the constant term of Jaclyn's polynomial?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Because the constant terms of both polynomials in the product are positive, are the same, and multiply to 4, they must each equal $\\sqrt{4} = \\boxed{2}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let Marcelle's polynomial be\n\\[P(z) = z^4 + az^3 + bz^2 + az + c.\\]Then by Vieta's formulas, $a + c = -3,$ $b + ac = 1,$ $a + b + c = -1,$ and $ac + b + c = 2.$  Subtracting the first two equations, we get\n\\[b - a^2 c + a = 4.\\]Subtracting the last two equations, we get\n\\[a + 2c = -3.\\]From $a + c = -3,$ $a + 2c = -3,$ we get $c = -3$ and $a = 0.$  Then $b - a^2 c + a = 4$ gives us $b = 1.$\n\nThus, Marcelle's polynomial is $z^4 + z^2 - 3.$  Hence, Jaclyn's polynomial is\n\\[z^4 + az^3 + bz^2 + az - 3.\\]From the given product, we see that Jaclyn's polynomial is $z^4 + az^3 + z^2 + az - 3.$  The constant term is then $\\boxed{-3}.$"
