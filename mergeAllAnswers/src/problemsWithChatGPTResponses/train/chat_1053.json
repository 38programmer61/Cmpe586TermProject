                "content": "Let $l$ be the length of the garden and $w$ be the width. We have $l=2w$. The perimeter is $2l+2w=60$. Substituting the value for $l$ from the second equation into the first equation, we get $2(2w)+2w=60$. Simplifying the left side of the equation gives $6w=60$. Dividing both sides by 6 gives $w=10$. Substituting this value into the equation $l=2w$ gives $l=20$. Thus, the area of the garden is $l\\cdot w=20\\cdot10=\\boxed{200}$ square feet.",
