    "problem": "Find the center of the circle with equation $x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Completing the square, we get $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19$. Therefore, the center of the circle is $\\boxed{(3, -1)}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "To begin, we can rewrite the equation as $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19$. In this form, the equation fits the standard form of the equation of a circle, $(x-h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h,k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is its radius. Thus, the center of the circle is $\\boxed{(3, -1)}$."
