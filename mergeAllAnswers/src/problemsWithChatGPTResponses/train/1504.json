    "problem": "An amoeba is placed in a puddle one day, and on that same day it splits into two amoebas.  The next day, each new amoeba splits into two new amoebas, and so on, so that each day every living amoeba splits into two new amoebas. After one week, how many amoebas are in the puddle? (Assume the puddle has no amoebas before the first one is placed in the puddle.)",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "At the end of the first day, there are 2 amoebas.  At the end of the second, there are $2\\cdot 2 = 2^2$ amoebas.  At the end of the third day, there are $2\\cdot 2^2 = 2^3$ amoebas, and so on.  So, after the seventh day, there are $2^7= \\boxed{128}$ amoebas.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let's trace the growth of the amoebas over the course of one week:\n\nDay 1: 1 amoeba\nDay 2: 1 amoeba splits into 2 amoebas, so there are 2 amoebas\nDay 3: Each of the 2 amoebas from Day 2 splits into 2 new amoebas, so there are 4 amoebas\nDay 4: Each of the 4 amoebas from Day 3 splits into 2 new amoebas, so there are 8 amoebas\nDay 5: Each of the 8 amoebas from Day 4 splits into 2 new amoebas, so there are 16 amoebas\nDay 6: Each of the 16 amoebas from Day 5 splits into 2 new amoebas, so there are 32 amoebas\nDay 7: Each of the 32 amoebas from Day 6 splits into 2 new amoebas, so there are 64 amoebas\n\nTherefore, after one week, there are 64 amoebas in the puddle."
