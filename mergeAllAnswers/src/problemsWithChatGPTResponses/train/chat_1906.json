                "content": "We let $g$ be the number of girls on the chess team, so $b+g=26$. Since half of the girls attended the meeting, there were $g/2$ girls present, and since all of the boys attended, there were $b$ boys present. Since $16$ members attended the meeting, $b+g/2=16$. Substituting $g=26-b$ into this equation to eliminate $g$ gives $b+(26-b)/2=16.$ Multiplying both sides by $2$ and simplifying gives $2b+26-b=32.$ Subtracting $26$ from both sides gives $b=6$. There are $\\boxed{6}$ boys on the chess team.",
