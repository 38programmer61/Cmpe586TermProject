    "problem": "What is the sum of the first 10 odd positive integers?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The first 10 positive odd integers are 1, 3, $\\dots$, 19.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum of the first 10 positive odd integers is \\[\\frac{1 + 19}{2} \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{100}.\\]",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The first odd positive integer is 1, and the next odd positive integer is 3 (which is 2 more than 1). Then, the next odd positive integer is 5 (which is 2 more than 3), and so on. Thus, the sequence of the first 10 odd positive integers is: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19. \n\nTo find the sum of these integers, we can add them together using addition: \n\n1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 = 100.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the first 10 odd positive integers is 100."
