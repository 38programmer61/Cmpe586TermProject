    "problem": "What is the positive difference of the solutions of $\\dfrac{r^2-3r-17}{r+4}=2r+7$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Factoring the quadratic in the numerator does not look pleasant, so we go ahead and multiply through by the denominator to get \\begin{align*}\nr^2-3r-17&=(r+4)(2r+7)\\\\\nr^2-3r-17&=2r^2 + 15r + 28\\\\\nr^2+18r+45&=0\\\\\n(r+3)(r+15)&=0\n\\end{align*}Therefore the solutions are $r=-3$ and $r=-15$ which have a difference of $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by $r + 4$ to find that $r^2 - 3r - 17 = 2r^2 + 15r + 28$. Simplifying the equation, we have $r^2 + 18r + 45 = 0$. Notice that this equation factors as $(r + 3)(r + 15) = 0$. Thus, the solutions to the equation are $r = -3, -15$.\n\nSince the problem asks for the positive difference between the solutions, we do not have to worry about considering the negative root $r = -15$. Our answer is $\\boxed{12}$."
