                "content": "Let L and J be the current age of Louise and James.\nWe have J = L + 6.\nWe have J + 8 = 4(L - 4).\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get L + 6 + 8 = 4(L - 4).\nCombining like terms, we get L + 14 = 4L - 16.\nSubtracting L from both sides, we get 14 = 3L - 16.\nAdding 16 to both sides, we get 30 = 3L.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get L = 10.\nSubstituting this value into the equation J = L + 6, we get J = 16.\nThe sum of their current ages is 10 + 16 = <<10+16=26>>26 years old. Answer: \\boxed{26}.",
