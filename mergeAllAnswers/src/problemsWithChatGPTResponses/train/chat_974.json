                "content": "To begin, we can rewrite the given equation in standard form by completing the square for $x$ and $y$. \n\nStarting with $x^2+y^2 + 21 = 4x + 18 y,$ we can rearrange the terms to obtain $x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 18y + 21 = 0.$\n\nCompleting the square for $x,$ we add $(4/2)^2=4$ to both sides of the equation, giving us $(x-2)^2 + y^2 - 18y + 21 = 4.$\n\nNext, we complete the square for $y,$ by adding $(18/2)^2=81$ to both sides of the equation. This gives us $(x-2)^2 + y^2 - 18y + 21 + 81 = 4 + 81.$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we have $(x-2)^2 + (y-9)^2 = 85.$\n\nThe equation is now in standard form, where the equation of a circle with center $(h, k)$ and radius $r$ is given by $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2.$\n\nTherefore, the radius of the cookie is $\\sqrt{85} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{85}}.$",
