Similarly, swapping $5$ lunks for $3$ kunks is the same as swapping $1\\frac{2}{5}$ lunks for $2$ kunks, which we know will buy $4$ apples.  Hence we see that $4$ apples can be traded for $1\\frac{2}{5}$ lunks. \n\nSince $1 \\frac{2}{5}$ lunks will buy $4$ apples, we see that $1$ lunk will buy $\\frac{4}{1 \\frac{2}{5}} = \\frac{20}{7}$ apples.  We have \\begin{align*}\n1\\text{ lunk} &= \\frac{20}{7}\\text{ apples}, \\\\\n\\frac{7}{20}\\text{ lunk} &= 1\\text{ apple}.\n\\end{align*}Hence, we see that a dozen, or $12$ apples, will be $\\dfrac{7}{20}\\cdot12 = \\boxed{4\\frac{1}{5}}$ lunks.",
