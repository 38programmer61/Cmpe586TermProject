                "content": "We are told that the dimensions of the field are $2m+7$ and $m-2$. The area of the field is given by the product of its dimensions: $(2m+7)(m-2)$. We are also given that this area is $51$ square units: \\begin{align*}\n&(2m+7)(m-2)=51.\n\\end{align*} To solve, we could multiply out the left-hand side and get a quadratic equation, but an easier way is to look at the factors of $51$ and see if we can find any two that add or subtract to get $(2m+7)$ or $(m-2).$  The prime factorization of $51$ is $51 = 3\\cdot17$. We try different pairs of factors until we find a pair that differ by $9$; the pair $3\\cdot17 = 51$ works: \\begin{align*}\n&(2m+7)(m-2)=51\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow(2m+7) = 17\\quad\\text{and}\\quad(m-2)=3 \\quad\\text{or} \\quad(2m+7) = 3\\quad\\text{and}\\quad(m-2)=17.\n\\end{align*} Setting $(2m+7) = 17\\quad\\text{and}\\quad(m-2)=3$ gives \\begin{align*}\n2m+7 &= 17 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n2m &= 10 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nm&= 5.\n\\end{align*}Setting $ (2m+7) = 3 \\quad\\text{and} \\quad(m-2)=17$ gives \\begin{align*}\n2m+7 &= 3 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n2m &= -4 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nm&= -2.\n\\end{align*} Since a length cannot be negative, the only solution is $m=\\boxed{5}$.",
