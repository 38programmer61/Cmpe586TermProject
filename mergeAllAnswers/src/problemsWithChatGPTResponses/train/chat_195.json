                "content": "We begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by $r + 4$ to find that $r^2 - 3r - 17 = 2r^2 + 15r + 28$. Simplifying the equation, we have $r^2 + 18r + 45 = 0$. Notice that this equation factors as $(r + 3)(r + 15) = 0$. Thus, the solutions to the equation are $r = -3, -15$.\n\nSince the problem asks for the positive difference between the solutions, we do not have to worry about considering the negative root $r = -15$. Our answer is $\\boxed{12}$.",
