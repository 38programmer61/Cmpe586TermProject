                "content": "The sum of all the positive integers from 1 to 50 can be found using the formula $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, where $n$ is the highest positive integer being summed. In this case, $n = 50$, so Jo's sum is $\\frac{50(50+1)}{2} = \\frac{50(51)}{2} = 25(51) = 1275$.\n\nTo find Kate's sum, we need to find the sum of the rounded values of the first 50 positive integers. Rounding each integer to the nearest multiple of 10 (rounding 5s up) gives us the following list: 10, 10, 20, 20, 30, 30, 40, 40, 50, 50, 60, 60, 70, 70, 80, 80, 90, 90, 100, 100, 110, 110, 120, 120, 130, 130, 140, 140, 150, 150, 160, 160, 170, 170, 180, 180, 190, 190, 200, 200, 210, 210, 220, 220, 230, 230, 240, 240, 250, 250, 260, 260.\n\nAdding up these values gives us $10+10+20+20+\\cdots+260+260$. We can see that each multiple of 10 appears twice, so we can rewrite this sum as $(10+20+30+\\cdots+250+260)+(10+20+30+\\cdots+250+260)$. We know that the sum of the first 26 positive integers is $\\frac{26(26+1)}{2}=13(27)=351$, so the sum of the first 13 multiples of 10 is $10\\cdot351=3510$. Thus, Kate's sum is $3510+3510=7020$.\n\nThe positive difference between Jo's sum and Kate's sum is $7020-1275=\\boxed{5745}$.",
