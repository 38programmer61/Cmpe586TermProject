    "problem": "If $y= \\frac{x^2+2x+8}{x-4}$, at what value of $x$ will there be a vertical asymptote?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "A function will have a vertical asymptote where the denominator equals zero and the degree of that root is greater than the degree of the same root in the numerator.  Here, the denominator is zero at $x = 4.$  The degree of this root is 1.  The number has no root at $x = 4$ (degree 0), so there is a vertical asymptote at $x=\\boxed{4}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "A vertical asymptote occurs at $x = a$ if the function is discontinuous at $x = a$, and $\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)$ is either $\\infty$ or $-\\infty$. Thus, we check for discontinuity in $\\frac{x^2+2x+8}{x-4}$. Since a rational function is continuous except at the zeros of the denominator, we first find the zeros of $x-4$. We set $x - 4 = 0$, so $x = 4$. Note that the function is continuous at all other values of $x$. Also, note that the denominator is zero when $x = 4$, so there is a vertical asymptote at $x = 4$. Answer: $\\boxed{4}$."
