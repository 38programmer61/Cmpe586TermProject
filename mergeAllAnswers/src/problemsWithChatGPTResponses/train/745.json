    "problem": "What is the sum of $1+2+4+8+16+ \\cdots + 1024$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "This is a finite geometric series with first term 1, common ratio 2 and 11 terms. Thus the sum is: $$\\frac{1(1-2^{11})}{1-2} = \\frac{1-2^{11}}{-1} = 2^{11}-1 = 2048-1 = \\boxed{2047}.$$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since this is a geometric sequence with first term $a = 1$ and common ratio $r = 2$, the sum $s_n$ of the first $n$ terms is given by $s_n = \\frac{a(r^n-1)}{r-1}$.  Therefore, the sum of the sequence $1+2+4+8+16 + \\cdots + 1024$ is $s_{10} = \\frac{1(2^{10}-1)}{2-1} = \\boxed{2047}$."
