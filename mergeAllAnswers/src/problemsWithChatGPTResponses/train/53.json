    "problem": "The teacher asks Bill to calculate $a-b-c$, but Bill mistakenly calculates $a-(b-c)$ and gets an answer of 11. If the correct answer was 3, what is the value of $a-b$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Instead of calculating $a - b - c$, Bill calculated $a - b + c$.  Therefore, the value of $a - b$ is simply the average of the two, making for $\\frac{11+3}{2} = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since Bill did $a-(b-c)$ instead of $a-b-c$, we have $a-b+c=11$. If the correct answer is 3, then $a-b-c=3$. Subtracting these two equations we get \\begin{align*}\na-b+c-(a-b-c)&=11-3\\\\\n2c&=8\n\\end{align*} Hence, $c=4$. Subtracting $a-b+c=11$ with $a-b-c=3$ we have $2c=8$ and $-2c=-8$, or $-2c-(a-b+c)=-8-(11)$. This gives $a-b-2c = -19$.  The problem asks for $a-b$, so we have $-19 + 2c = -19 + 2\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{-11}$."
