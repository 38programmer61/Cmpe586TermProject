    "problem": "What is the sum of the the roots of the equation $4x^3 + 5x^2 - 8x = 0$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First we can factor out an $x$. That gives us the equation $x(4x^2 + 5x - 8) = 0$. This product is equal to zero when $x = 0$ or when $(4x^2 + 5x - 8) = 0$. This root of zero contributes nothing to the sum of the roots. Now we don't actually need to factor $4x^2 + 5x - 8 = 0$ into the product of two binomials to find the sum of the roots. (It doesn't factor nicely.) If we divide both sides of this equation by 4, we get $x^2\n+ (5/4)x - 2 = 0$. The coefficient of the middle term (5/4) is the opposite of the sum of the roots, so our answer is $\\boxed{-1.25}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We can factor out an $x$: $x(4x^2+5x-8)=0$. So either $x=0$, or $4x^2+5x-8=0$. We can solve the quadratic by factoring. $4x^2+5x-8=(4x-1)(x+8)$. So the solutions to the quadratic are $\\frac14$ and $-8$. Adding these three solutions gives us $\\frac14+(-8)=\\boxed{-7.75}$."
