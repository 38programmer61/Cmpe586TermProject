    "solution": "There are three denominators in the formula for $f(x)$: $$x, \\quad 1+\\frac 1x, \\quad 1+\\frac{1}{1+\\frac 1x}.$$ For $f(x)$ to be undefined, one of these denominators must be $0$. We go through them one by one.\n\nThe simplest denominator, $x$, is $0$ if $x=0$.\n\nThe second denominator, $1+\\frac 1x$, is $0$ if $x=-1$.\n\nThe third denominator, $1+\\frac{1}{1+\\frac 1x}$, is $0$ if $$\\frac{1}{1+\\frac 1x} = -1.$$ We can solve like this: \\begin{align*}\n-1 &= 1+\\frac 1x \\\\\n-2 &= \\frac 1x \\\\\nx &= -\\frac 12\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus, the sum of the three points not in the domain of $f(x)$ is $0+(-1)+\\left(-\\frac 12\\right) = \\boxed{-\\frac 32}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "First note that $f(x)=\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{x}}}=\\frac 1{1+\\frac{1+x}{x}}=\\frac 1{\\frac{x+1+x}{x}}=\\frac {x}{2x+1}.$ Thus, we want to find the $x$ such that $\\frac {x}{2x+1}$ is undefined. Since the denominators of a fraction cannot be $0,$ $2x+1\\ne 0 \\Rightarrow 2x\\ne -1 \\Rightarrow x\\ne -\\frac{1}{2}.$ Similarly, since the denominator cannot be $0,$ $x\\ne 0.$ Thus, since $x\\ne -\\frac 12$ and $x\\ne 0,$ the three real numbers not in the domain of $f(x)$ are $-\\frac 12,0,$ and $-\\frac 12.$ Thus, $-\\frac 12+0-\\frac 12=\\boxed{-1}$ is the sum of those three numbers, as desired."
