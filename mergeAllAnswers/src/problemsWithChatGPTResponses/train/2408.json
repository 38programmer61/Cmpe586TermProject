    "problem": "Evaluate $\\lceil-2.4\\rceil$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $-2.4$ is $-2$. Therefore, $\\lceil-2.4\\rceil=\\boxed{-2}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Recall that the ceiling function $\\lceil x\\rceil$ means to find the least integer that is greater than or equal to $x$. In this case, there are two integers that are both greater than or equal to $-2.4$: $-2$ and $-1$. However, the least integer is $-2$, so $\\lceil -2.4\\rceil = \\boxed{-2}$."
