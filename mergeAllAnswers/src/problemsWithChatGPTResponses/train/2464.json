    "problem": "The product of two positive consecutive integers is 506. What is their sum?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We are given that $x(x+1) = 506$, so $x^2 + x = 506$, which means $x^2 + x - 506 =0$.  The prime factorization of $506$ is $2\\cdot 11 \\cdot 23$, so we see that the quadratic factors as $(x + 23)(x-22)=0$.  The positive solution is $x=22$, so the two numbers are 22 and 23.  Their sum is $22+23 = \\boxed{45}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the two consecutive positive integers be $n$ and $n+1.$  Then $n(n+1) = 506,$ which simplifies to $n^2 + n - 506 = 0.$\n\nWe can factor this as $(n - 22)(n + 23) = 0.$  We discard the negative solution, so $n = 22.$  Then the sum of the two integers is $22 + 23 = \\boxed{45}.$"
