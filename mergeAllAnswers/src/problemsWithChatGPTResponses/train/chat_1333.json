                "content": "To expand the product ${(x+2)(x+5)}$, we can use the distributive property. We multiply each term in the first factor, $x+2$, by each term in the second factor, $x+5$, and then combine like terms.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$(x+2)(x+5) = x(x+5) + 2(x+5)$\n\nExpanding further, we multiply each term in the first term of the product, $x$, by each term in the second factor, $x+5$, and then combine like terms:\n\n$= x(x) + x(5) + 2(x+5)$\n\n$= x^2 + 5x + 2(x+5)$\n\nExpanding again, we multiply each term in the second term of the product, $2$, by each term in the second factor, $x+5$, and then combine like terms:\n\n$= x^2 + 5x + 2x + 10$\n\nFinally, we combine like terms:\n\n$= x^2 + (5x + 2x) + 10$\n\n$= x^2 + 7x + 10$\n\nTherefore, the expanded form of the product ${(x+2)(x+5)}$ is $x^2 + 7x + 10$.",
