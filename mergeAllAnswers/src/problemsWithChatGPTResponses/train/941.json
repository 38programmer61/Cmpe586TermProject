    "chatgpt_solution": "Using the formula for the slope of a line, the slope between $P$ and $Q$ is $\\frac{y-7}{4 - (-2)}=\\frac{y-7}{6}$.  Setting this slope equal to $-\\frac32$, we have \\[\n\\frac{y-7}{6} = -\\frac32.\n\\] We cross-multiply and solve for $y$: \\begin{align*}\ny - 7 &= -\\frac{18}{2} \\\\\ny - 7 &= -9 \\\\\ny &= \\boxed{-2}.\n\\end{align*}"
