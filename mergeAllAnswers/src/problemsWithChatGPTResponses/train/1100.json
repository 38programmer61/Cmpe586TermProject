    "problem": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the two distinct solutions to the equation $$(x-5)(2x+9) = x^2-13x+40.$$What is $(p + 3)(q + 3)$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can expand the left side to simplify, or we might notice that $x^2-13x+40 = (x-5)(x-8).$ Thus, we see that $(x-5)(2x+9) = (x-5)(x-8).$ Simplifying, we have $(x-5)(2x+9) - (x-5)(x-8) = (x-5)(x+17) = 0.$ Therefore, $p$ and $q$ are 5 and -17, and $(p + 3)(q + 3) = (8) (-14) = \\boxed{-112}.$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "First, we expand the product on the left-side of the equation: \\begin{align*}\n(x-5)(2x+9) &= x^2 - 5 \\cdot 2x + 9 \\cdot x - 5 \\cdot 9 \\\\\n&= x^2 - 13x - 45.\n\\end{align*}So we have $$x^2 - 13x - 45 = x^2 - 13x + 40.$$The quadratic $x^2 - 13x + 40 = 0$ factors as $(x-5)(x-8)=0$.  Thus, the solutions are $p=5$ and $q=8$.  Consequently, $$(p+3)(q+3) = (5+3)(8+3) = \\boxed{88}.$$"
