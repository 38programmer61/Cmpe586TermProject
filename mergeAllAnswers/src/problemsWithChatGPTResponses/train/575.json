    "problem": "What is the domain of the function $$u(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt x}~?$$ Express your answer in interval notation.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "For $u(x)$ to be defined, $\\sqrt x$ must be defined and nonzero. This is true for $x$ in the domain $\\boxed{(0,\\infty)}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The function $u(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}$ is defined only for positive values of $x$, since the square root function $\\sqrt{x}$ is undefined for negative $x$. Therefore, the domain of $u(x)$ is $(0,\\infty)$."
