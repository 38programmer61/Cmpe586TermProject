    "problem": "Compute the sum of all the roots of $(2x+3)(x-4)+(2x+3)(x-6)=0$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The quadratic factors as $(2x + 3)(x - 4 + x - 6) = (2x + 3)(2x - 10) = 2(2x + 3)(x - 5).$  Thus, the roots are $-\\frac{3}{2}$ and 5, and their sum is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}.$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Factoring $(2x+3)(x-4)$ out of each term in the equation, we get $(2x+3)(x-4)+(2x+3)(x-6) = (2x+3)(x-4+x-6)$. Simplifying, we have $(2x+3)(2x-10)$.  Since $(2x+3)(2x-10)=0$, we have $2x+3=0$ or $2x-10=0$.  Solving the first equation gives $x=\\boxed{-\\frac32}$, and solving the second equation gives $x=\\boxed{5}$.  Therefore, the sum of all the roots is $-\\frac32+5=\\boxed{\\frac52}$."
