                "content": "Since $x^2+100x+c$ is equal to the square of a binomial, we know it is of the form $(x+a)^2$ for some constant $a$. Expanding $(x+a)^2$ gives $x^2+2ax+a^2$, so we equate the coefficients to find $2ax=100x$ and $a^2=c$. From the first equation, we have $2ax=100x$ so $2a=100$ and $a=50$. This means $a^2=50^2=\\boxed{2500}$.",
