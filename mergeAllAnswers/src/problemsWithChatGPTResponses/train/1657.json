    "problem": "John believes that the amount of sleep he gets the night before a test and his score on that test are inversely related.  On his first exam, he got eight hours of sleep and scored 70 on the exam.  To the nearest tenth, how many hours does John believe he must sleep the night before his second exam so that the average of his two exam scores is an 80?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First, to average an 80, he must score a 90 on his second exam.  Now, since score and hours of sleep are inversely related, their product is a constant.  Thus $70\\cdot 8 = 90 \\cdot h \\Rightarrow h = 56/9 \\approx \\boxed{6.2}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let x represent the number of hours John believes he must sleep the night before his second exam.\nWe are given that the amount of sleep John gets and his exam score are inversely related. We can represent this relationship using the formula: score = k/hours. In this formula, k is the constant of variation.\nWe know that John got 8 hours of sleep and scored 70 on the first exam. We can plug these values into the formula to find the value of k: 70 = k/8.\nTo solve for k, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 8: 560 = k.\nNow that we know k, we can use it to write an equation relating the number of hours of sleep John gets and his exam score: score = 560/hours.\nWe want the average of John's scores to be 80. This means that the sum of his scores divided by 2 is equal to 80. We can write this as the equation: (70 + score)/2 = 80.\nWe want to solve this equation for score, so we can multiply both sides by 2: 70 + score = 160.\nSubtract 70 from both sides to isolate the score variable: score = 90.\nNow that we know the score John wants to achieve on his second exam, we can plug it into our equation relating score and hours of sleep: 90 = 560/hours.\nTo solve for hours, we can multiply both sides of the equation by hours: 90*hours = 560.\nDivide both sides by 90 to isolate hours: hours = 560/90 \u2248 <<560/90=6.2>>6.2 hours.\nTo the nearest tenth, John believes he must sleep 6.2 hours the night before his second exam. Answer: \\boxed{6.2}."
