                "content": "Begin by subtracting $\\sqrt{1}$ from both sides, and we have $\\sqrt{2y-3} = \\sqrt{6}-1$. Squaring both sides, we have $2y-3 = (\\sqrt{6}-1)^2 = 7-2\\sqrt{6}$. Adding $3$ and dividing by $2$ to both sides gives $y = \\frac{10-2\\sqrt{6}}{2} = \\boxed{5-\\sqrt{6}}$. (Be careful: one might get the extraneous solution $5+\\sqrt{6}$ by incorrectly squaring $\\sqrt{6}-1$, so after you know one potential answer, check for the extraneous one!)",
