    "solution": "Let's perform the addition one step at a time. The first step is adding $c$ and $a$ in the right column. Since $c$ and $a$ can't both be 0 and $c+a$ is at most $9+8=17$, we know that $c+a=10$. The one carries over.\n\nThe second step is adding $b$ and $c$ in the middle column. Similarly, we know that $b+c+1=10$ (the one is from the carrying over), so $b+c=9$. The one carries over.\n\nThe third step is adding $a$ and $d$ in the left column. Similarly, we know that $a+d+1=10$ so $a+d=9$.\n\nThus, we have the three equations \\begin{align*}\na+c&=10\\\\\nb+c&=9\\\\\na+d&=9\n\\end{align*} Adding the last two equations gives $b+c+a+d = 9 + 9 =18$, so our answer is $\\boxed{18}$. This corresponds to $(a,b,c,d)\\Rightarrow (4,3,6,5)$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "From the diagram, we have the equation \\[100(2a) + 10(2b) + 2(c+d) = 100(1) + 10(0) + (1+0).\\]Multiplying out and simplifying both sides gives \\[200a + 20b + 2c + 2d = 101.\\]Dividing by 2 gives \\[100a + 10b + c + d = 50 + \\tfrac{1}{2}.\\]The left side of this equation is an integer, so the right side must be an integer.  Since $50$ is an integer, it follows that $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ must represent $0.$  Therefore, \\[100a + 10b + c + d = 50,\\]which means \\[a + b + c + d = \\boxed{5}.\\]"
