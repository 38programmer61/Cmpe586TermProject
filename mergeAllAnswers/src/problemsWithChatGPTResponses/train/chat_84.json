                "content": "We observe that both terms on the left side of the equation have denominators of $y-1$ and $3y-2$, so it would be nice if the denominators could be combined. In particular, we want to make the denominators the same. Since $(y-1)(3y-2) = 3y^2 - 5y + 2$, we observe that we can achieve this by multiplying both terms on the left side by $\\dfrac{3y-2}{3y-2}$: \\begin{align*}\n\\dfrac{y^2 - 9y + 8}{y-1} + \\dfrac{3y^2 +16y-12 }{3y -2} &= -3 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad \\left(\\dfrac{y^2 - 9y + 8}{y-1}\\right)\\left(\\dfrac{3y-2}{3y-2}\\right) + \\left(\\dfrac{3y^2 +16y-12 }{3y -2}\\right)\\left(\\dfrac{3y-2}{3y-2}\\right) &= -3 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad \\dfrac{(y^2 - 9y + 8)(3y-2)}{(y-1)(3y-2)} + \\dfrac{(3y^2 +16y-12)(3y-2)}{(3y -2)(3y-2)} &= -3 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad \\dfrac{(y^2 - 9y + 8)(3y-2) + (3y^2 +16y-12)(3y-2)}{(y-1)(3y-2)} &= -3.\n\\end{align*}Since the denominators are now identical, we can add the fractions on the left and simplify the numerator. Expanding everything and collecting like terms, we get \\begin{align*}\n-3 &= \\dfrac{(3y^3 - 20y^2 + 29y - 16) + (9y^3 + 41y^2 - 30y - 8)}{(y-1)(3y -2)} \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{12y^3 + 21y^2 - 1}{(y-1)(3y -2)}.\n\\end{align*}Thus, we have $12y^3 + 21y^2 - 1 = -3(y-1)(3y-2) = -9(y^2-1y-2)=-9y^2+9y+18.$ Shifting all of the terms to one side gives $12y^3 - 30y^2 - 30y - 19 = 0.$ Since all of the answer choices are integers, we try drawing the rational root theorem (first, checking $y= \\pm 1$) and find that $y = \\boxed{-1}$ is a root of the equation.",
