                "content": "We set up a system of equations. For $a<b$, we have $a+b = \\frac{11}{12}$ and $ab = \\frac{1}{6}$. From the first equation, $b = \\frac{11}{12}-a$, which we substitute into the second equation to get $a\\left(\\frac{11}{12}-a\\right) = \\frac{1}{6}$. Expanding, we have $\\frac{11}{12}a-a^2 = \\frac{1}{6}$. Multiplying through by $12$, we have $11a-12a^2 = 2$. Rearranging into standard quadratic form, we have $12a^2-11a+2 = 0$ and factoring $(4a-1)(3a-2)=0$. Since $a$ is the lesser of the two fractions, $a = \\frac{1}{4}$. The answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",
