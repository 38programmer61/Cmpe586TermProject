    "problem": "A grocer makes a display of cans in which the top row has one can and each lower row has two more cans than the row above it. If the display contains 100 cans, how many rows does it contain?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The number of cans in each row form an arithmetic sequence, with first term 1 and common difference 2.  If there are $n$ terms, then the terms are 1, 3, $\\dots$, $2n - 1$.\n\nThe total number of cans is therefore the sum of the arithmetic series \\[1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + (2n - 1).\\]The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $[1 + (2n - 1)]/2 \\cdot n = n^2$.\n\nThen from $n^2 = 100$, we get $n = \\boxed{10}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let's assume there are n rows in total.\nThe number of cans in the top row is 1.\nThe number of cans in the second row is 1+2=<<1+2=3>>3.\nThe number of cans in the third row is 3+2=<<3+2=5>>5.\nSimilarly, the number of cans in the nth row is 1+2*(n-1).\nSo, the total number of cans in n rows is 1+3+5+...+ (1+2*(n-1)).\nThis sum can be written as n^2.\nSince the total number of cans is given as 100, n^2=100.\nn=10.\nTherefore, there are 10 rows in the display. Answer: \\boxed{10}."
