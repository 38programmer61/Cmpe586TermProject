                "content": "Adding twice the first equation to three times the second, we find that $66x+66y=123$.  Dividing both sides by 66, we have $x+y=\\frac{123}{66}$.  We subtract the second equation from the first and divide by 9 to find that $x-y=-2$.  Adding these two equations, we find that $2x=\\frac{123}{66}-2=\\frac{41}{22}$.  Subtracting these two equations, we find that $2y=2- \\frac{41}{22}=\\frac{3}{22}$.  Dividing by 2 we find that $y=\\frac{3}{44}$.  Thus $y=\\frac{3}{44}$ and $x=y+2=\\frac{91}{44}$, giving our solution $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{91}{44},\\frac{3}{44}\\right)}$.",
