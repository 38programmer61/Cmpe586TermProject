    "problem": "Find the slope of the line $3x+5y=20$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can find the slope and the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept quickly by putting the equation in slope-intercept form.  Solving the equation $3x+5y=20$ for $y$ in terms of $x$ gives $y = -\\frac{3}{5}x +4$.  So, the slope is $\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{5}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Subtracting $3x$ from both sides and dividing both sides by $5$, we find $y = -\\frac35x + 4$. Therefore, the slope of the line is $\\boxed{-\\frac35}$."
