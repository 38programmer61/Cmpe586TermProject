                "content": "The first term of the sequence is $\\frac18$, and the common ratio is $\\frac12$. We wish to find the largest $n$ such that \\[\\frac18\\left(\\frac{1-\\left(\\frac12\\right)^n}{1-\\frac12}\\right)=\\frac{63}{128}.\\] Simplifying, we get \\[\\frac18\\left(\\frac{2^n-1}{2}\\right)=\\frac{63}{128}.\\] Cross-multiplying the fractions and simplifying gives us \\[8(2^n-1)=63(2).\\] Finally, dividing by $8$ and then adding $1$ to both sides, we have \\[2^n-1=16+1=17.\\] The largest integer power of $2$ less than $17$ is $2^4=16$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{5}$.",
