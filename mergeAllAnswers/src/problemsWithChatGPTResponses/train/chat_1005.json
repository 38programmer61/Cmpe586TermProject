                "content": "Let the number of days he works be $x$, and the number of days he does not work be $y$. We have two equations: \\begin{align*}\n60x + 30y& =660, \\\\\nx + y &= 20.\n\\end{align*} Dividing the first equation by 30, we have $2x+y=22$. Subtracting the second equation from the third equation, we get $x=2$. Then the second equation tells us $y=18$. Hence, he does not work $\\boxed{18}$ days.",
