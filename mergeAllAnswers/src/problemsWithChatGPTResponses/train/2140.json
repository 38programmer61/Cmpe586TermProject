    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If the number is $x$, we have $\\frac{11}{100}x=77\\qquad\\Rightarrow x=77\\cdot\\frac{100}{11}=7\\cdot100=700$. The number is $\\boxed{700}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "To find the number, we can set up the equation: \n\n0.11x = 77\n\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.11:\n\nx = 77 / 0.11 = 700\n\nTherefore, eleven percent of 700 is 77."
