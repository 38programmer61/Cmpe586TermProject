    "problem": "Given two real numbers $p>1$ and $q>1$ so that $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$ and $pq = 4$, what is $q$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Solving $pq = 4$ for $p$ we see that $p = \\frac{4}{q}$. Plugging this into $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$ we then get \\[ \\frac{q}{4} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1 \\Rightarrow q^2 - 4q +4 = 0 .\\] Factoring this, we then see that  \\[ (q-2)(q-2) = 0 \\] which means that $q = \\boxed{2}$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We are given that $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$. Clearing the denominators gives $q + p = pq$. Since $pq = 4$, it follows that $q + p = 4$. Since $p >1$ and $q >1$, the only pair of $p$ and $q$ that satisfy this equation is $p=3$ and $q=1$. However, $q>1$, so there are no values of $p$ and $q$ that satisfy the given conditions. Thus, there is no value of $q$, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{no solution}}$."
