                "content": "To solve for $x$, we must eliminate $y$ from the given equations.  Multiplying both sides of the first equation by 2 gives us $4x - 2y = 10$.  Because $x+2y=5$, we can subtract the second equation from the first and obtain $3x = 5$. Dividing both sides of the equation $3x = 5$ by 3 gives us $x = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{3}}$.",
