    "solution": "Writing the equation $\\log_{81} (2r-1) = -1/2$ in exponential notation gives $2r-1 = 81^{-1/2} = (9^2)^{-1/2} = 9^{-1} = 1/9$. Solving $2r-1 = 1/9$ gives $r = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We can rewrite the equation $\\log_{81}(2r - 1) = -\\frac12$ as $81^{-1/2} = 2r - 1$. Writing the left side with the base reversed and swapping the bases, we have $2r - 1 = (81^{1/2})^{-1} = 9^{-1}$, so $2r - 1 = \\frac19$. Solving yields $r = \\frac{10}{18} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$."
