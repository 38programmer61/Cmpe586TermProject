    "problem": "The sequence $2, 7, 12, a, b, 27$ is arithmetic. What is the value of $a + b$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The common difference of the arithmetic sequence is $7-2=5$.  Therefore, the first six terms of the sequence are 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, and 27.  The sum of $a$ and $b$ is $17+22=\\boxed{39}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The common difference in this sequence is $7-2 = 5$. Therefore, the missing numbers must be $12+5 =17$ and $17+5 = \\boxed{22}$."
