                "content": "We see that $9x^2 - 30x - 42$ does not have a linear term when expanded. We look at the constant term, and check that there is no way to rewrite $-42$ as a sum of two squares. So the answer is $0$. There is a quicker way to obtain this result: Because the quadratic does not have a linear term, we know that the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is an integer. Because the quadratic is of the form $(ax+b)^2+c,$ the vertex of the quadratic is $(\\frac{-b}{2a}, c)$. Therefore, we know that $\\frac{30}{18}$ is an integer, which allows us to immediately say that the product of $\\frac{-b}{2a}$ does not matter. Hence, the answer is $\\boxed{0}$.",
