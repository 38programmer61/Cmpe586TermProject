                "content": "We are given that $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$ and $pq = \\frac{9}{2}$.  Multiplying both sides of $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$ by $pq$, we obtain \\[\\frac{pq}{p} + \\frac{pq}{q} = pq,\\]which becomes $q + p = \\frac{9}{2}$.  Since we are told that $p<q$, we have \\[q + p = \\frac{9}{2} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad q - p > 0.\\]Adding these two inequalities, we get $2q > \\frac{9}{2}$, so $q>\\frac{9}{4}$.  Since $p<q$, we have \\[p + 2p = 3p < \\frac{9}{4} + \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{9}{2} < q + p = \\frac{9}{2},\\]so $3p<\\frac92$, which forces $p<\\frac32$. Therefore, since $p$ is a fraction between $\\frac32$ and $\\frac92$, $q$ must be bigger than $\\frac92$.  So, the only number that is both greater than $\\frac92$ and greater than $\\frac{9}{4}$ is $\\boxed{\\frac92}$.",
