    "problem": "A shirt regularly priced at $\\$30$ is on sale for $20\\%$ off. Mary has a coupon that will take another $25\\%$ off of the sale price. What single percent discount would give the same final price as the two successive discounts?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Applying a $20\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $1-20\\%=1-0.2=\\frac{4}{5}$.  Similarly, applying a $25\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $\\frac{3}{4}$.  Applying both discounts, we multiply by $\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{3}{5}=0.6$.  Since $1-0.6=0.4=40\\%$, multiplying by 0.6 gives a $\\boxed{40\\%}$ discount.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since \"percent of a percent\" deals can be tricky, we invoke some subterfuge by promoting Mary's coupon to be a discount off the regular price, resulting in $\\$30-(25\\%)(\\$30)=\\$30-\\$7.50=\\$22.50$. Since the two successive discounts result in $\\$22.50$, then a single discount of $(\\$30-\\$22.50)/(\\$30)\\approx \\boxed{25\\%}$ would result in the same sale price."
