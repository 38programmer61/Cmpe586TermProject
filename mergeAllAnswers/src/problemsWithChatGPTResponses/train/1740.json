    "problem": "A box with a volume of 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold 50 paperclips. How many paperclips could a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ hold?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of paperclips that a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ could hold. Setting up the ratio $\\frac{50}{16}=\\frac{x}{48}$ and solving for $x$ gives $x=150$.  Hence, a 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ box could hold $\\boxed{150}$ paperclips.  We also could have noted that tripling the size of the box triples the number of paperclips we can hold, so the new box can hold $50\\cdot 3 = 150$ paperclips.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We can set up a proportion with the volume of a box and the number of paperclips it can hold.\nThe proportion is $\\frac{16}{50}=\\frac{48}{x}$, where $x$ is the number of paperclips that could fit in the larger box.\nCross multiplying, we have $16\\cdot x=50\\cdot 48$, so $x=\\frac{50\\cdot 48}{16}=\\frac{2}{1}\\cdot 3\\cdot 50=\\boxed{150}$. Answer: \\boxed{150}."
