                "content": "Let $\\lfloor r \\rfloor = n$ and $r = a$, where $n$ is an integer and $0 \\leq a < 1$. Because $r$ can also be written as $n+a$, the equation becomes: $n+n+a=12.2$. Simplifying, we have: $2n+a=12.2$. Since $a < 1$, $2n+a=n+1$. We can obtain $a$ in terms of $n$ by subtracting $n$ from both sides of the equation: \n\n\\begin{align*}\na&=1.\n\\end{align*}Since the answer must satisfy the condition $0 \\leq a < 1$, $a = 1$ is not a valid solution. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{\\text{no solutions}}$ for $r$.",
