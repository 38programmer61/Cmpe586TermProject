                "content": "Let $\\text{\\textdollar} a$ be the price of a sack of apples. There are two important equations given in the problem: \\begin{align*}\n0a+0b+0c+2d&=20\\\\\n0a-b+(a-b)&=20\n\\end{align*} The first equation represents the cost of the apples, bananas, cantaloupe, and dates. In this equation, $a$ refers to apples, $b$ refers to bananas, $c$ refers to cantaloupes, and $d$ refers to dates. Since the first equation states that a carton of dates costs twice as much as a sack of apples, we conclude that $2a=20\\Rightarrow a=10$. We now substitute $a=10$ into the second equation and solve for $b$. \\begin{align*}\n0(10)-b&+(10-b)=20\\\\\n0-b+10-b&=20\\\\\n20-2b&=20\\\\\n-2b&=0\\\\\nb&=0\n\\end{align*}Since $b$ refers to bananas, this means that George pays $\\boxed{0}$ to purchase the bananas. Alternatively, we could substitute $a=10$, $b=0$ into the second equation, and solve for $c$: \\begin{align*}\n0(10)-0+(10-b)&=20\\\\\n0+10-b&=20\\\\\n10-b&=20\\\\\n-b&=10\\\\\nb&=-10\n\\end{align*} This answer doesn't make logical sense so we reject it.",
