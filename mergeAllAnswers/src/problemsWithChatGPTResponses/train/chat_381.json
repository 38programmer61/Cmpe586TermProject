                "content": "For Alice we have $3b + 2s = 320$, and for Bill we have $2b + s = 200$, where $b$ is the cost of a burger and $s$ is the cost of a soda, all in cents.\n\nMultiplying the second equation by 3 to make coefficients line up, we have $6b + 3s = 600$. Subtracting twice the second equation from the first, we have $6b + 4s - (4b + 2s) = 600-400$ or $2b + 2s = 200$. Dividing by 2 we have $b + s = 100$.\n\nSubtracting this last equation from $3b + 2s = 320$, we have $2b-s = 320-100$ or $2b = 220$ or $b=\\boxed{110}$. Algebra made this problem easier by allowing us to eliminate $s$ as we tried to solve for $b$.",
