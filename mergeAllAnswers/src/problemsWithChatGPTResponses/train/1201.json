    "problem": "If the ratio of $b$ to $a$ is 3, then what is the value of $a$ when $b=12-5a$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The given ratio tells us that $\\frac{b}{a}=3$ or that $b=3a$. We substitute this value for $b$ so we have an equation with only one variable. We find  \\begin{align*}\n3a&=12-5a \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 8a&=12 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad a &= 12/8 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad a &= \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "If the ratio of $b$ to $a$ is $3$, then we can write $\\frac{b}{a}=3$.  Multiplying both sides by $a$ yields $b=3a$.  Plugging this expression for $b$ into the equation $b=12-5a$, we get $3a=12-5a$.  Adding $5a$ to both sides and subtracting $3a$ from both sides, we have $8a=12$.  Dividing both sides by $8$, we obtain $a=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$."
