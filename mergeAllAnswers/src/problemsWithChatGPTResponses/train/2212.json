    "solution": "Let $a=2013$. The expression is equal to $\\frac{a^3-2a^2(a+1)+3a(a+1)^2-(a+1)^3+1}{a(a+1)}$. We notice a common factor of $a(a+1)$ in the second and third terms of the numerator, so we split the fraction apart: $$\\frac{-2a^2(a+1)+3a(a+1)^2}{a(a+1)}+\\frac{a^3-(a+1)^3+1}{a(a+1)}$$The first part of the expression is equal to $-2a+3(a+1)$, which simplifies to $a+3$.\n\nThe second part of the expression has a numerator that can be factored as a difference of cubes. We will concentrate on the numerator for now: \\begin{align*}\na^3-(a+1)^3+1 &= (a-(a+1))(a^2+a(a+1)+(a+1)^2)+1 \\\\\n&= (-1)(a^2+a^2+a+a^2+2a+1)+1 \\\\\n&= (-1)(3a^2+3a+1)+1 \\\\\n&= -3(a^2+a)-1+1 \\\\\n&= -3a(a+1)\n\\end{align*}Alternatively, we can expand the numerator, and factor:\n\\begin{align*}\na^3 - (a + 1)^3 + 1 &= a^3 - (a + 1)(a + 1)(a + 1) + 1 \\\\\n&= a^3 - (a^2 + 2a + 1)(a + 1) + 1 \\\\\n&= a^3 - (a^3 + 3a^2 + 3a + 1) + 1 \\\\\n&= a^3 - a^3 - 3a^2 - 3a - 1 + 1 \\\\\n&= -3a^2 - 3a \\\\\n&= -3(a^2 + a) \\\\\n&= -3a(a + 1).\n\\end{align*}Taken with the denominator, the second half of the expression simply equals $\\frac{-3a(a+1)}{a(a+1)}=-3$.\n\nPutting it back with the first half of the expression, the final expression equals $(a+3)+(-3)=a=\\boxed{2013}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We notice a common pattern: we have sequential powers of $2013$ and $2014$ as the terms and coefficients of the numerator of a fraction. This is reminiscent of the binomial coefficients, more particularly the differences between consecutive combinations in Pascal's Triangle, which is a consequence of the Binomial Theorem. Thus, the numerator of the fraction, when expanded fully, will have a term for each entry in a row with $2015$ terms in Pascal's Triangle, and the vast majority of the terms in the numerator will cancel each other out, caused by the subtraction of the term $2014^3$. This will leave us with just $2013^3$ and $1$. We can substitute the values back into the numerator to verify this: \\begin{align*}\n(2013 - 2014)^3 &=2013^3 - 3 \\cdot 2013^2 \\cdot 2014 + 3 \\cdot 2013 \\cdot 2014^2 -  2014^3\\\\\n&=2013^3 - 3 \\cdot 2013^2 \\cdot 2014 + 3 \\cdot 2013 \\cdot 2014^2 -  2014^3 + (2014^3 - 2013^3)\\\\\n&=2013^3 - 2 \\cdot 2013^2 \\cdot 2014 + 3 \\cdot 2013 \\cdot 2014^2 -  2014^3 +1.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the value of the fraction is simply $\\boxed{2013^2 - 1}$."
