                "content": "Let's start by assuming that the number of blue marbles in the bag before removing any is 8x, and the number of yellow marbles is 5x.\nAfter removing 12 blue marbles, we have 8x - 12 blue marbles.\nAfter adding 21 yellow marbles, we have 5x + 21 yellow marbles.\nNow, we have the following ratio: (8x - 12) : (5x + 21) = 1 : 3.\nCross multiplying, we get 3(8x - 12) = (5x + 21).\nExpanding the brackets, we get 24x - 36 = 5x + 21.\nSubtracting 5x from both sides, we get 19x - 36 = 21.\nAdding 36 to both sides, we get 19x = 57.\nDividing both sides by 19, we get x = 3.\nTherefore, there were 8x = 8(3) = <<8*3=24>>24 blue marbles in the bag before removing any. Answer: \\boxed{24}.",
