                "content": "Let the two consecutive page numbers be $n$ and $n + 1.$ Then we have the equation $$n(n + 1) = 18{,}360.$$We can write $18{,}360 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19.$ To make the left-hand side into this factorization, we look for factors of $n$ that are one less than $n + 1$ (since then, when we multiply, we will get one factor of $n,$ and one factor of $n + 1$). Checking potential factors starting with $n = 2,$ we find that $n = 170.$\n\nTherefore, the two consecutive page numbers are $170$ and $170 + 1 = 171.$ Their sum is $170 + 171 = \\boxed{341}.$\n\nIndeed, notice that $341 = 11^3.$",
