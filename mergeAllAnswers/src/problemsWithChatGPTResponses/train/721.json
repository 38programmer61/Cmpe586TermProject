    "solution": "The greatest integer that is less than or equal to $0.999$ is $0$, so $\\lfloor0.999\\rfloor=0$. The smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $2.001$ is $3$, so $\\lceil2.001\\rceil=3$. Therefore, $\\lfloor0.999\\rfloor+\\lceil2.001\\rceil=0+3=\\boxed{3}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The greatest integer less than $0.999$ is $0$, and the smallest integer greater than $2.001$ is $3$. Therefore, $\\lfloor0.999\\rfloor=0$ and $\\lceil2.001\\rceil=3$. The sum is $0+3=\\boxed{3}$."
