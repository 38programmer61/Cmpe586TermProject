    "problem": "Find an ordered pair $(u,v)$ that solves the system: \\begin{align*} 5u &= -7 - 2v,\\\\ 3u &= 4v - 25 \\end{align*}",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Multiplying the first equation by $2$ gives $10u = -14 - 4v$.  Adding this to the second equation gives $13u = -39$, so $ u= -3$.  Substituting this into $5u=-7-2v$ gives $-15=-7-2v$, so $v = 4$ and our solution is $(u,v) =\\boxed{(-3,4)}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since we want to solve for $(u, v),$ we see that it is necessary to eliminate the variable $v.$ To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by $-1,$ so that we have the same coefficient for $v.$ Multiplying the first equation by 2 gives \\begin{align*}\n2\\cdot5u&=2\\cdot(-7-2v),\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 10u&=-14-4v.\n\\end{align*}Multiplying the second equation by $-1$ gives  \\begin{align*}\n-1\\cdot3u&=-1\\cdot(4v-25),\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -3u&=-4v+25.\n\\end{align*}Using the distributive property and combining like terms gives  \\begin{align*}\n10u&=-14-4v,\\\\ -3u&=-4v+25.\n\\end{align*}Thus, we have $-4v$ equal to $-4v$ in each equation, so we can set the two expressions equal to each other \\[-14-4v=-4v+25.\\]Simplifying gives $14=25,$ which is obviously false. Therefore, there must be no solution to the system of equations. Thus, there is $\\boxed{\\text{no solution}}$ to the system of equations."
