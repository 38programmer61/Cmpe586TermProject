    "solution": "We can split the expression $|3x+7|=26$ into two separate cases: $3x+7=26$ and $3x+7=-26$. For the first case, solving for $x$ would give us $x=\\frac{26-7}{3}=\\frac{19}{3}$. For the second case, we would get $x=\\frac{-26-7}{3}=\\frac{-33}{3}=-11$. Therefore, $x=\\frac{19}{3}$ and $x=-11$ both satisfy the equation. Since the problem asks for the smallest value of $x$, our solution is $\\boxed{-11}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since $|3x+7|=26$ is equivalent to $3x+7=26$ or $3x+7=-26$, we solve these two equations separately:\n\nFor $3x+7=26$, we subtract $7$ from both sides to find $$3x=26-7=19.$$Dividing both sides by $3$, we have $$x=\\frac{19}{3}.$$We see that $\\frac{19}{3}$ satisfies the equation since $$|3(\\frac{19}{3})+7|=|19+7|=|26|=26.$$For $3x+7=-26$, we subtract $7$ from both sides to find $$3x=-26-7=-33.$$Dividing both sides by $3$, we have $$x=-\\frac{33}{3}=-11.$$We see that $-11$ satisfies the equation since $$|3(-11)+7|=|-33+7|=|-26|=26.$$Thus, the two possible values for $x$ are $\\frac{19}{3}$ and $-11$. The smallest value is $-11$. Thus, the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $|3x+7|=26$ is $\\boxed{-11}$."
