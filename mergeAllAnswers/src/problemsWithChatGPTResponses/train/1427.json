    "problem": "Find the fraction that equals $0.\\overline{73}$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have \\[0.\\overline{73} = \\frac{73}{100} + \\frac{73}{10000} + \\frac{73}{1000000} + \\cdots.\\]This infinite geometric series has first term $73/100$ and common ratio $1/100$, so we have \\[0.\\overline{73} = \\frac{73/100}{1-1/100} = \\boxed{\\frac{73}{99}}.\\]",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We let $x=0.\\overline{73}$ so that $100x=73.\\overline{73}$. Subtracting the left-hand side from the right-hand side, we have $100x-x = 73.\\overline{73}-0.\\overline{73} = 73$. Simplifying the left-hand side gives $99x=73$, and so $x=\\boxed{\\frac{73}{99}}$.
