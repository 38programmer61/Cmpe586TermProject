There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so there are 12*12=<<12*12=144>>144 square inches in 1 square foot.\nTherefore, the area of the room in square inches is 225*144=<<225*144=32400>>32,400 square inches.\nSince each tile is 6 inches by 6 inches, the area of each tile is 6*6=<<6*6=36>>36 square inches.\nThus, the number of tiles in each row is 32,400/36=<<32400/36=900>>900. Answer: \\boxed{900}.",
