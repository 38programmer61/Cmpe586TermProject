    "problem": "If $\\log_6 (4x)=2$, find $\\log_x 27$. Express your answer in simplest fractional form.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We begin by solving for $x$ from the first equation $\\log_6 (4x)=2$. Expressing this in exponential form, we find that $4x=6^2$, giving us $x=\\frac{6^2}{4}=9$. After plugging this value of $x$ into $\\log_x 27$, we end up with the expression $\\log_9 27$. Since $27=(9)(3)=(9^1)(9^{\\frac12})=9^{\\frac32}$, we see that $\\log_9 27=\\boxed{\\frac32}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Writing the first equation in exponential form gives $6^2=4x$, or $x=9$. The second equation can also be written in exponential form as $x^{\\log_x27}=27$, and since $x=9$, this equation simplifies to $9^{\\log_927}=27$, or $3^3=27$. Therefore, $\\log_x27=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$."
