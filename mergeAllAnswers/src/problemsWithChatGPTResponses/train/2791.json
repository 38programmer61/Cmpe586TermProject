    "problem": "For what value of $m$ does the equation $(x+4)(x+1) = m + 2x$ have exactly one real solution? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We begin by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation and adding $-m-2x$ to both sides. We get $x^2+3x+(4-m)=0$. For this quadratic to have exactly one real root, the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ must be equal to $0$. Thus, we require $9-4(4-m) = 0$. Solving, we get that $m=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{4}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "By simplifying the equation and moving all the terms to one side, we have $x^2+5x + 4 = m$. Setting the discriminant equal to zero, we have $5^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 4 = 9$, hence $m = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{4}}$."
