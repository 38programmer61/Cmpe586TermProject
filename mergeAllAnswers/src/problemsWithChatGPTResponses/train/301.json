    "problem": "The Cookie Monster encounters a cookie whose boundary is the equation $x^2+y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3 y$ and is very confused. He wants to know if this cookie is a lunch-sized cookie or a snack-sized cookie. What is the radius of this cookie?",

    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The equation $x^2+y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3 y$ can be rewritten as $x^2-x+y^2-3y=6.5$. Completing the square and writing decimals as fractions, this can further be rewritten as $\\left( x - \\dfrac{1}{2} \\right)^2 - \\dfrac{1}{4} + \\left( y - \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)^2 - \\dfrac{9}{4}=\\dfrac{13}{2}$. Moving the constants to the right side of the equation, this is $\\left( x - \\dfrac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( y - \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)^2 = \\dfrac{10}{4}+\\dfrac{13}{2}=\\dfrac{18}{2}=9$, which is the equation of a circle with center $\\left( \\dfrac{1}{2}, \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)$ and radius $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "To find the radius of the cookie, we need to complete the square on the equation $x^2+y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3 y.$\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation in standard form:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 - x + y^2 - 3y &= 6.5 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow (x^2 - x + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2) + (y^2 - 3y + \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2) &= 6.5 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow (x - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + (y - \\frac{3}{2})^2 &= 6.5 + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{9}{4} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow (x - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + (y - \\frac{3}{2})^2 &= 8.25.\n\\end{align*}We see that the equation of the boundary can be written in the form $(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2,$ where $(a, b)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius of the circle. Comparing this with $(x - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + (y - \\frac{3}{2})^2 = 8.25,$ we see that the center of the circle is $(a, b) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}\\right)$ and the radius of the circle is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{8.25}}.$"
