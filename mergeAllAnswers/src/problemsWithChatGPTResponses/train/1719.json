    "problem": "Find the ordered pair $(m,n)$, where $m,n$ are positive integers satisfying the following equation:\n$$14mn = 55 - 7m - 2n$$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Looking at the form of the equation, we see that we have two linear terms and their product.  We thus apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick.  The given equation rearranges to $14mn + 7m +2n +1 = 56$, which can be factored to $(7m + 1)(2n +1) = 56 = 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 7$.  Since $n$ is a positive integer, we see that $2n +1 > 1$ is odd.  Examining the factors on the right side, we see we must have $2n + 1 = 7$, implying $7m+1 = 2^3$.  Solving, we find that $(m,n) = \\boxed{(1,3)}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Adding $14mn+77$ to both sides of the equation simplifies it to $$(7m+2)(2n+14)=77.$$ The pairs of positive factors of $77$ are $1$ and $77$, $7$ and $11$, so we have two equations to consider:\n\\begin{align*}\n&1) \\quad \\begin{cases} 7m+2=1 \\\\ 2n+14=77 \\end{cases} &\\text{or}& &2) \\quad \\begin{cases} 7m+2=7 \\\\ 2n+14=11 \\end{cases} \\\\\n& \\quad \\begin{cases} 7m= -1 \\\\ 2n= 63 \\end{cases} &\\text{or}& & \\quad \\begin{cases} 7m= 5 \\\\ 2n= -3 \\end{cases}. \\\\\n\\end{align*}For the first system, the only solution is $(m, n) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{7}, \\frac{63}{2}\\right),$ which is not in the domain of positive integers. For the second system, we have $(m,n) = \\boxed{(1, -1)}.$"
