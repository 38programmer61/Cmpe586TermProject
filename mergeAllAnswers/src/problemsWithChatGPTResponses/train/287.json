    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The integer is $\\boxed{1}$, since $1^2=1<2$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The only integer whose square is less than its double is 1. \n\nIf we let x be the integer, we can set up the inequality:\n\nx^2 < 2x\n\nRearranging, we have:\n\nx^2 - 2x < 0\n\nFactoring out an x, we get:\n\nx(x - 2) < 0\n\nFor this inequality to be true, x must be a positive integer less than 2. The only integer that satisfies this condition is 1."
