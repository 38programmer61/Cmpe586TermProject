                "content": "A quadratic equation has rational solutions if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square. The discriminant of the given equation is $11^2-4(5)(c)=121-20c$. Thus $121-20c=n^2$ for some integer $n$. Since $20c$ is a multiple of $5$ while $121$ is not, we know that $n$ is also a multiple of $5$; let $n=5d$. Then $25(5-4c)=25d^2$, so $5-4c=d^2$ for some (positive) integer $d$. Rearranging, we have $d^2+4c=5$.\n\nNow we do some casework. Note that $(d,c)=(1,1)$ is a solution to $d^2+4c=5$. If $c>1$, then $d^2+4c>5$, and if $d>1$, then $d^2+4c\\geq 9$. Thus $(d,c)=(1,1)$ is the unique pair with $d$ and $c$ positive integers, and the corresponding values for $c$ are $1$ and the trivial $0$. The product of these is $\\boxed{0}$.",
