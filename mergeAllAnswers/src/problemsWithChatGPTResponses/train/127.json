    "problem": "The equation $y = -16t^2 + 80t$ describes the height (in feet) of a projectile launched from the ground at 80 feet per second. At what $t$ will the projectile reach 36 feet in height for the first time? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest tenth.",

    "solution": "Setting $y$ to 36, we find the following: \\begin{align*}\n36& = -16t^2 + 80t\\\\\n0 & = -16t^2 + 80t - 36\\\\\n& = 4t^2 - 20t + 9\\\\\n& = (2t - 1)(2t - 9)\n\\end{align*}Our possible values for $t$ are $\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$ or $\\frac{9}{2} = 4.5.$ Of these, we choose the smaller $t$, or $\\boxed{0.5}.$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We are given that $y = -16t^2 + 80t$ and we want to find the value of $t$ such that $y = 36$. So, we set $-16t^2 + 80t = 36$ and subtract $36$ from both sides to obtain $-16t^2 + 80t - 36 = 0$. We can divide the equation by $4$ to simplify the equation to $-4t^2 + 20t - 9 = 0$. Factoring the quadratic or applying the quadratic formula gives us $(t-1.5)(4t-6) = 0$. So, either $t-1.5 = 0$ or $4t-6=0$. Solving each equation gives us $t = 1.5$ or $t = 1.5$. The \"first\" time $y$ is equal to $36$ is $t = \\boxed{1.5}$."
