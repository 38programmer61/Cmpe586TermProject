    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "$1<\\frac54<2$, so the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\\frac54$ is $2$. Similarly, $-2<-\\frac54<-1$, so the largest integer less than or equal to $-\\frac54$ is $-2$. The original expression, $\\left\\lceil{\\frac54}\\right\\rceil+\\left\\lfloor{-\\frac54}\\right\\rfloor$, is equal to the sum of the two, which is just $2+(-2)=\\boxed{0}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $\\frac54$ is $2$, so $\\left\\lceil{\\frac54}\\right\\rceil = 2$. The largest integer that is less than or equal to $-\\frac54$ is $-2$, so $\\left\\lfloor{-\\frac54}\\right\\rfloor = -2$. Therefore, $\\left\\lceil{\\frac54}\\right\\rceil+\\left\\lfloor{-\\frac54}\\right\\rfloor = 2 + (-2) = \\boxed{0}.$"
