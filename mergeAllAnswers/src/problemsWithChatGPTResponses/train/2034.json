    "problem": "A horse 24 feet from the center of a merry-go-round makes 32 revolutions. In order to travel the same distance, how many revolutions would a horse 8 feet from the center have to make?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The radius of the circular path of the horse closer to the center is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the radius of the path of the horse farther from the center.  Since circumference is directly proportional to radius, the length of shorter path is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the length of the longer path.  Therefore, 3 times as many revolutions must be made to go the same distance, which is $32\\times3=\\boxed{96}$ revolutions.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We can assume that the distance traveled by the horse is proportional to the number of revolutions it makes.\n\nLet's call the original number of revolutions made by the horse at 24 feet as $R_1$ and the number of revolutions the horse will have to make at 8 feet as $R_2$.\n\nThe distance traveled by the horse is given by the formula $d = 2\\pi r \\cdot n$, where $d$ is the distance traveled, $r$ is the distance from the center, and $n$ is the number of revolutions.\n\nFor the horse at 24 feet, we have $d_1 = 2\\pi(24)R_1$.\n\nTo find the number of revolutions the horse at 8 feet will have to make, we can set up a proportion:\n\n$\\frac{d_1}{R_1} = \\frac{d_2}{R_2}$\n\nSubstituting the values we know:\n$\\frac{2\\pi(24)R_1}{R_1} = \\frac{2\\pi(8)R_2}{R_2}$\n\nSimplifying:\n$48\\pi = 16\\pi R_2$\n\nDividing both sides by $16\\pi$:\n$R_2 = \\frac{48\\pi}{16\\pi} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3$\n\nTherefore, the horse at 8 feet from the center would have to make 3 revolutions in order to travel the same distance."
