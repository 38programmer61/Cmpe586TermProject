                "content": "Let the two integers be $x$ and $y$. The problem states $xy + x + y = 95$. Factoring we have $(x+1)(y+1)=96$. The prime factorization of $96$ is $2^5\\cdot3$. Since $x$ and $y$ are less than $20$, $x+1$ and $y+1$ must be among the following pairs of factors: $(1,96),(2,48),(3,32),(4,24),(6,16),(8,12),(16,6),(12,8),(24,4),(32,3),(48,2),(96,1)$. Testing all of these we find that $(x,y)=(5,4),(23,1)$. The problem states that $x$ and $y$ are less than $20$, so $(x,y)=(5,4)$. The sum of the two integers is $\\boxed{9}$.",
