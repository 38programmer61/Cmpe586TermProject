    "problem": "The sequence 1,000,000; 500,000; 250,000 and so on, is made by repeatedly dividing by 2. What is the last integer in this sequence?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Repeatedly dividing by 2, we find the next terms in the sequence to be 125000, 62500, 31250, 15625,... 15625 is no longer a multiple of 2, so when we divide by 2 again, we will not get an integer, nor will it be a multiple of 2. Thus, no number in the sequence after 15625 can be an integer. Thus, our answer is $\\boxed{15625}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "By dividing the terms of the sequence by 2, we can see that each term is half of the previous term. Therefore, the sequence can be written as:\n\n1,000,000, 1,000,000/2, (1,000,000/2)/2, ((1,000,000/2)/2)/2, ...\n\nTo find the last integer in this sequence, we need to continue dividing until we reach a value where the next division would result in a non-integer value.\n\n1,000,000/2 = 500,000\n500,000/2 = 250,000\n250,000/2 = 125,000\n125,000/2 = 62,500\n62,500/2 = 31,250\n31,250/2 = 15,625\n\nAt this point, the next division by 2 would result in a non-integer value since 15,625 \u00f7 2 = 7,812.5. Therefore, the last integer in the sequence is 15,625."
