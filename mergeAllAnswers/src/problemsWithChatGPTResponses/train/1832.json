    "problem": "Given that $M(2,5)$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ and $A(3,1)$ is one endpoint, what is the product of the coordinates of point $B$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the coordinates of point $B$ $(x,y)$. Because the coordinates of a midpoint of a line segment are the average of the coordinates of the two endpoints, we have that $\\frac{3+x}{2} = 2$ and $\\frac{1+y}{2} = 5$. Solving for $x$ and $y$ yields $x = 1$ and $y = 9$. Thus, point $B$ has coordinates $(1,9)$, so the product of its coordinates is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "If $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ and $A$ is one endpoint, the coordinates of $B$ can be found by moving right $1$ unit and up $4$ units from $A$. Therefore, the coordinates of $B$ are $(3+1,1+4)=(4,5)$. The product of the $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate is $4\\cdot5=\\boxed{20}$."
