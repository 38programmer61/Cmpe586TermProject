                "content": "Let the first term be $a$ and the common difference be $d$.  Then the second term is $a + d$, and the fourth term is $a + 3d$.  The sum of the second and fourth terms is $(a + d) + (a + 3d) = 2a + 4d = 6$, which implies $2a + 4d - 6 = 0$.  Since the common difference is $d$, the third term is $a + 2d$.  Subtracting $2(a + d)$ from $2a + 4d - 6 = 0$ gives \\[-2d - 6 = 0.\\] Hence, $d = -3$, so the third term is $a + 2d = \\boxed{6}.$",
