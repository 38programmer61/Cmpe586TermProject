    "problem": "Each of the ten volumes of the collected works of Theodore Sturgeon is available in paperback for $\\$$15 or in hardcover for $\\$$25. Theresa buys a copy of each of the ten volumes for a total of $\\$$220. How many hardcover volumes did she buy?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Say she bought $h$ hardcovers and $p$ paperbacks. She bought ten volumes total, so $h+p=10$. Her total cost, $25h+15p$, was $220$, or dividing by 5 $5h+3p=44$. Multiplying the first equation by 3 and subtracting it from the second, we get $5h-3h+3p-3p=2h=44-30=14$, or $h=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let $h$ be the number of hardcover volumes and $p$ be the number of paperback volumes.  We have the equations \\begin{align*}\np+h&=10 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad h=10-p, \\\\\n15p+25h&=220.\n\\end{align*} Subtracting five times the first equation from the second, we have $15p+25h-5(p+h)=220-5\\cdot 10$, which simplifies to $10p+20h=170$.  Subtracting twice the first equation from the second gives $15p+25h-2(p+h)=220-2\\cdot 10$, so $11p+23h=200$. Since $ p$ and $ h$ are integers, $p$ must be a multiple of 10. The only solutions are $p=0$, $h=10$, and $p=10$, $h=0$.  Therefore, Theresa bought $\\boxed{10}$ hardcover volumes."
