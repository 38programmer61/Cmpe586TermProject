    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can solve for $x$ and $y$, then plug them in to get our answer. However, there is a nicer method. Note that \\begin{align*}\n5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2 &= (4x^2 + 4xy + y^2) + (x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2) \\\\\n&= (2x + y)^2 + (x + 2y)^2 = 4^2 + 5^2 = \\boxed{41}.\n\\end{align*}.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We can factor our expression for $5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2$ as $(x + y)(5x + 5y) + 3xy$.  From our given equations, we get $(x + y)(5x + 5y) + 3xy = 4(5) + 3 = \\boxed{23}$."
