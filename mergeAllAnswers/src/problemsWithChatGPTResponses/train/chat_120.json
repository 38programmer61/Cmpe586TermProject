                "content": "Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be $a$, and let the common difference be $d$.  Since the sum of the first four terms is 10, we have $a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) = 10$.  Expanding the left side gives $4a + 6d = 10$.  Since the fifth term is 5, we have $a + 4d = 5$.  Substituting $a = 5 - 4d$ from the second equation into the first equation to eliminate $a$ gives $4(5 - 4d) + 6d = 10$, or $20 - 16d + 6d = 10$.  Solving this equation gives $d = \\frac{5}{6}$.  Substituting $d = \\frac{5}{6}$ into $a + 4d = 5$ gives $a = 5 - 4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{5}{3}$.  The sixth term is then $a + 5d = \\frac{5}{3} + 5 \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{20}{3}}$.",
