    "problem": "How many pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ satisfy $x^2-y^2=51$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Factoring, we have $(x+y)(x-y)=51$.  Since $x,y$ are positive, we have $x+y>x-y>0$.  Note that $51=51*1=17*3$.  Thus either $x+y=51$, $x-y=1$ or $x+y=17$, $x-y=3$.  Solving in the first case gives $x=26,y=25$, and the second case gives $x=10,y=7$.  Thus there are $\\boxed{2}$ pairs $(x,y)$ that solve the equation.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We factor the difference of squares to obtain $(x + y)(x - y) = 51$.  We prime factorize 51 into $3 \\cdot 17$, so we get four cases.\n\nCase 1: $(x + y) = 1$ and $(x - y) = 51$.  Solving gives $x = 26$, $y = 25$.\n\nCase 2: $(x + y) = 3$ and $(x - y) = 17$.  Solving gives $x = 10$, $y = -7$.  But $y$ must be positive, so there are no solutions in this case.\n\nCase 3: $(x + y) = 17$ and $(x - y) = 3$.  Solving gives $x = 10$, $y = 7$.\n\nCase 4: $(x + y) = 51$ and $(x - y) = 1$.  Solving gives $x = 26$, $y = 25$.\n\nIn total, there are $\\boxed{3}$ solutions."
