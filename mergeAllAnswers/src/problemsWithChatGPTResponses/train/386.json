    "solution": "By the quadratic formula, the equation $5x^2+11x+c=0$ has solutions $$x = \\frac{-(11)\\pm\\sqrt{(11)^2-4(5)(c)}}{2(5)} = \\frac{-11\\pm\\sqrt{121-20c}}{10}.$$For these solutions to be rational, the quantity under the square root (i.e., the discriminant) must be a perfect square. So, we seek the possible (positive integer) values of $c$ for which $121-20c$ is a square. The possible nonnegative values for $121-20c$ are $101$, $81$, $61$, $41$, $21$, or $1$. The only squares in this list are $81$, coming from $c=2$, and $1$, coming from $c=6$. So the product of the two possible $c$ values is $2\\cdot 6=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "A quadratic equation has rational solutions if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square. The discriminant of the given equation is $11^2-4(5)(c)=121-20c$. Thus $121-20c=n^2$ for some integer $n$. Since $20c$ is a multiple of $5$ while $121$ is not, we know that $n$ is also a multiple of $5$; let $n=5d$. Then $25(5-4c)=25d^2$, so $5-4c=d^2$ for some (positive) integer $d$. Rearranging, we have $d^2+4c=5$.\n\nNow we do some casework. Note that $(d,c)=(1,1)$ is a solution to $d^2+4c=5$. If $c>1$, then $d^2+4c>5$, and if $d>1$, then $d^2+4c\\geq 9$. Thus $(d,c)=(1,1)$ is the unique pair with $d$ and $c$ positive integers, and the corresponding values for $c$ are $1$ and the trivial $0$. The product of these is $\\boxed{0}$."
