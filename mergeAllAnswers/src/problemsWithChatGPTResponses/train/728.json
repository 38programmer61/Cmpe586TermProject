    "problem": "Jack rewrites the quadratic $9x^2 - 30x - 42$ in the form of $(ax + b)^2 + c,$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are all integers. What is $ab$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that $(ax + b)^2 + c = (a^2)x^2 + (2ab)x + b^2 + c,$ meaning that if this to equal $9x^2 - 30x - 42$, we start with $a^2 = 9,$ and so we let $a = 3.$ Then, $2ab = -30,$ so $b = -5.$ We do not need to find $c$ in this case, so our answer is $ab = \\boxed{-15}.$\n\nNote: Letting $a = -3$ gives us $(-3x+5)^2 + c,$ which gives us the same answer.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We see that $9x^2 - 30x - 42$ does not have a linear term when expanded. We look at the constant term, and check that there is no way to rewrite $-42$ as a sum of two squares. So the answer is $0$. There is a quicker way to obtain this result: Because the quadratic does not have a linear term, we know that the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is an integer. Because the quadratic is of the form $(ax+b)^2+c,$ the vertex of the quadratic is $(\\frac{-b}{2a}, c)$. Therefore, we know that $\\frac{30}{18}$ is an integer, which allows us to immediately say that the product of $\\frac{-b}{2a}$ does not matter. Hence, the answer is $\\boxed{0}$."
