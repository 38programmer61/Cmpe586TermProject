    "solution": "The greatest common factor of the two coefficients is $11$, and the greatest power of $z$ that divides both terms is $z^{17}$. So, we factor $11z^{17}$ out of both terms:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n55z^{17}+121z^{34} &= 11z^{17}\\cdot 5 +11z^{17}\\cdot 11z^{17}\\\\\n&= \\boxed{11z^{17}(5+11z^{17})}\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The greatest common factor of the two terms is $11z^{17}$. Factoring this out gives: \\begin{align*}\n55z^{17}+121z^{34} &= 11z^{17}(5+11z^{17})\n\\end{align*}Alternatively, we could note that the given expression is a sum of cubes and apply the formula $a^3+b^3=(a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$. In this case, $a=5z^{17}$ and $b=11z^{17}$, so the factored form is \\begin{align*}\n55z^{17}+121z^{34} &= (5z^{17})^3+(11z^{17})^3 \\\\\n&= (5z^{17}+11z^{17})((5z^{17})^2-(5z^{17})(11z^{17})+(11z^{17})^2) \\\\\n&= \\boxed{11z^{17}(5+11z^{17})}.\n\\end{align*}"
