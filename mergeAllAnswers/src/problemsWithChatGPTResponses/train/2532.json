    "problem": "Lisa has 10 friends and 34 marbles. What is the minimum number of additional marbles she needs so that she can give each friend at least one marble and no two friends receive the same number of marbles?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Lisa wants to minimize the number of marbles she gives to her friends without giving any two of them the same number of marbles. The minimum number of marbles she can give to a friend is 1. She then gives 2 marbles to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 10. The total number of marbles Lisa has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+10 = \\frac{10 \\cdot 11}{2}=55$.\n\nThus, Lisa needs $55-34=\\boxed{21}$ more marbles.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since Lisa needs to give each friend at least one marble, the first marble she gives to a friend does not affect the number of marbles she needs to give to the other friends. Thus, she needs to give the first friend 1 marble, the second friend 2 marbles, the third friend 3 marbles, and so on. The number of marbles needed to give to each friend forms an arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference 1.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: \nSum = (first term + last term) * number of terms / 2.\n\nThe last term of this sequence is the 10th term, which can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \nnth term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference.\n\nThe 10th term is 1 + (10 - 1) * 1 = 10.\n\nThus, the sum of the marbles needed is (1 + 10) * 10 / 2 = 55.\n\nSince Lisa already has 34 marbles, she needs an additional 55 - 34 = <<55-34=21>>21 marbles. Answer: \\boxed{21}."
