    "problem": "If the sum of the second and fourth terms of an arithmetic sequence is $6$, what is the third term?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the second term $a$, and the difference between any two consecutive terms $x$. So, the third term is $a+x$, and the fourth term is $a+2x$. Adding the second and fourth terms gives $2a+2x$, which is simply twice the third term. So the third term is $\\frac{6}{2} = \\boxed{3}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the first term be $a$ and the common difference be $d$.  Then the second term is $a + d$, and the fourth term is $a + 3d$.  The sum of the second and fourth terms is $(a + d) + (a + 3d) = 2a + 4d = 6$, which implies $2a + 4d - 6 = 0$.  Since the common difference is $d$, the third term is $a + 2d$.  Subtracting $2(a + d)$ from $2a + 4d - 6 = 0$ gives \\[-2d - 6 = 0.\\] Hence, $d = -3$, so the third term is $a + 2d = \\boxed{6}.$"
