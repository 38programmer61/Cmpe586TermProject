                "content": "For two lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal. Since the equation $y=8x+2$ is in slope-intercept form ($y=mx+b$) and its slope $m$ is 8, the slope of the second line will also be 8. We can set $(2c)x-4$ equal to $y$ to find the slope of the second line: $$\\begin{aligned} y &= (2c)x - 4 \\\\ 8 &= 2c. \\end{aligned}$$To solve for $c$, we divide both sides by 2: $c = \\boxed{4}.$",
