    "problem": "Given that $-7$ is a solution to $x^2 + bx -28 = 0$, what is the value of $b$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The product of the roots of this quadratic is $-28/1=-28$, so the other solution must be $-28/-7=4$. That means that the sum of the solutions is $-7+4=-3$. The sum of the solutions is also $-b/1=-b$. Thus, $-b=-3$ and $b=\\boxed{3}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since $-7$ is a solution to $x^2 + bx - 28 = 0$, then $(-7)^2 + b(-7) -28 = 0$.  Expanding the equation on the left produces $49 - 7b - 28 = 0$, so $-7b + 49 - 28 = 0$.  Hence, $-7b + 21 = 0$, and $-7b = -21$.  Dividing both sides by $-7$, we find $b = \\boxed{3}$."
