    "problem": "If $y = -x^2 + 5$ and $x$ is a real number, then what is the maximum value possible for $y$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the square of any real number is nonnegative, the greatest possible value of $-x^2$ is 0, which is achieved when $x=0$.  Therefore, the greatest possible value of $y = -x^2 + 5$ is $\\boxed{5}$, which is achieved when $x=0$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Recall that the graph of a parabola opens downward and has a vertex at its highest point. Since $y=-x^2+5$, the graph of this parabola has a maximum value at its vertex. To find the vertex, we can find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex using the formula $x=-\\frac{b}{2a}$, where a and b are the coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$, respectively, in the quadratic function. In this case, the coefficient of $x^2$ is $-1$, and the coefficient of $x$ is $0$, so $x=-\\frac{0}{2(-1)}=0$. Substituting $x=0$ into $y=-x^2+5$, we find that $y=-0^2+5=5$. Therefore, the maximum value of $y$ is $\\boxed{5}$."
