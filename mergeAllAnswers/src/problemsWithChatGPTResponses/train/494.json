    "problem": "Find the distance between the points (0,4) and (3,0).",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 4)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\boxed{5}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nWe note that the points $(0, 4)$, $(3, 0)$, and $(0, 0)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 3 and 4. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the hypotenuse must have length $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "To find the distance between two points in a coordinate plane, you can use the distance formula:\n\nd = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nUsing the points (0,4) and (3,0), plug in the values into the formula:\n\nd = sqrt((3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 4)^2)\n   = sqrt(3^2 + (-4)^2)\n   = sqrt(9 + 16)\n   = sqrt(25)\n   = 5\n\nTherefore, the distance between the points (0,4) and (3,0) is 5 units."
