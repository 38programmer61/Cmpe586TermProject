    "solution": "The greatest common factor of $37a^2$ and $111a$ is $37a$. We factor $37a$ out of both terms to get\\begin{align*}\n37a^2 + 111a &= 37a \\cdot a+ 37a \\cdot 3\\\\\n&=\\boxed{37a(a+3)}\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We can factor out the greatest common factor of the two terms, which is $37a$: \\begin{align*}\n37a^2 +111a &= \\boxed{37a}(a+3).\n\\end{align*}We could also factor out $a$: \\begin{align*}\n37a^2 +111a &= a(37a + 111).\n\\end{align*}"
