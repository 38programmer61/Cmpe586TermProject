                "content": "We can solve this problem by using a geometric sequence to represent the heights reached by the ball after each bounce.\n\nLet's denote the initial height of the ball as h_0 = 1000 feet.\nAfter the first bounce, the ball reaches a height of h_1 = (1/2)*h_0 = (1/2)*1000 = 500 feet.\nAfter the second bounce, the ball reaches a height of h_2 = (1/2)*h_1 = (1/2)*(1/2)*h_0 = (1/2)^2 * 1000 = 250 feet.\nSimilarly, after the third bounce, the ball reaches a height of h_3 = (1/2)*h_2 = (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*h_0 = (1/2)^3 * 1000 = 125 feet.\n\nWe observe that the height reached after each bounce follows a geometric sequence with the common ratio r = 1/2.\n\nTo find the number of bounces required for the ball to reach a maximum height less than 1 foot, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer n such that h_n < 1.\n\nWe can generalize the height reached after the n-th bounce as h_n = (1/2)^n * h_0.\n\nTo solve h_n < 1, we can plug in the values:\n(1/2)^n * 1000 < 1.\n\nDivide both sides of the inequality by 1000 to isolate the exponent:\n(1/2)^n < 1/1000.\n\nRewrite 1/1000 as a power of 1/2:\n(1/2)^n < (1/2)^3.\n\nSince the base of the exponentiation is the same, we can equate the exponents:\nn < 3.\n\nSince n must be a non-negative integer, the smallest solution is n = 2.\n\nTherefore, the ball will first reach a maximum height less than 1 foot after 2 bounces.",
