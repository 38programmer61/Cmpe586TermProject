    "problem": "The functions $f(x) = x^2-2x + m$ and $g(x) = x^2-2x + 4m$ are evaluated when $x = 4$. What is the value of $m$ if $2f(4) = g(4)$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "$2f(4)=g(4)$, so $2\\left(16-8+m\\right)=16-8+4m$. Expanding the left-hand side gives $16+2m=8+4m$, or $8=2m$ and $m=\\boxed{4}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We have $f(4) = 4^2-2(4) + m = 16 -8 + m = 8+m$, and $g(4) = 4^2-2(4) + 4m = 16-8 + 4m = 8+4m$.\n\nWe're given that $2f(4) = g(4)$, so $2(8+m) = 8+4m$, giving $16+2m = 8+4m$. Subtracting $2m$ and $8$ from both sides gives $8 = 2m$, so $m = \\boxed{4}$."
