                "content": "Let's call the two positive integers x and y. We are given that the difference between the two integers is 12, so we can write the equation x - y = 12.\n\nWe are also given that the product of the two integers is 45, so we can write the equation xy = 45.\n\nWe can solve these two equations by substitution. Solving the first equation for x, we find that x = y + 12. We can substitute this expression for x in the second equation: (y + 12)y = 45.\n\nExpanding the expression, we get y^2 + 12y = 45.\n\nRearranging the terms and subtracting 45 from both sides, we get y^2 + 12y - 45 = 0.\n\nFactoring this quadratic equation, we find (y + 15)(y - 3) = 0.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we find y + 15 = 0 or y - 3 = 0.\n\nSolving for y, we find that y = -15 or y = 3.\n\nSince we are given that the integers are positive, we can ignore the solution y = -15.\n\nTherefore, y = 3, and substituting this value back into the equation x = y + 12, we find x = 3 + 12 = 15.\n\nThe sum of the two positive integers is x + y = 15 + 3 = 18.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the integers is 18.
