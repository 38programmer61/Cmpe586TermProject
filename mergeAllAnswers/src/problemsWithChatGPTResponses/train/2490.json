    "problem": "The endpoints of a line segment are (2, 3) and (8, 15). What is the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)$ is $\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)$.\n\nThus, the midpoint of this line segment is $\\left(\\frac{2+8}{2}, \\frac{3+15}{2} \\right)$, which simplifies to $(5,9)$. Thus, the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint is $\\boxed{14}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) has coordinates given by the formulas:\n\n(x1 + x2)/2 and (y1 + y2)/2.\n\nIn this case, the coordinates of the endpoints are (2, 3) and (8, 15). \n\nThus, the coordinates of the midpoint are given by:\n\n(x1 + x2)/2 = (2 + 8)/2 = 10/2 = 5\n(y1 + y2)/2 = (3 + 15)/2 = 18/2 = 9\n\nTherefore, the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint is 5 + 9 = 14. Answer: \\boxed{14}."
