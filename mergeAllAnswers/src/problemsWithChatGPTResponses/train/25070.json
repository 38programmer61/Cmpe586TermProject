    "problem": "To calculate $41^2$, David mentally figures the value $40^2$ and adds 81. David subtracts a number from $40^2$ to calculate $39^2$. What number does he subtract?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We see that $39^2 = (40 - 1)^2 = 40^2 - 2\\cdot 40 \\cdot 1 +1 = 40^2 - 79$. Therefore, David subtracts $\\boxed{79}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Denote the unknown subtraction quantity as $x$. Since $39^2 = 40^2 - x$, and $40^2 = 1600$, $39^2 = 1600 - x$. From the first sentence, we equate $39^2 + x$ with $41^2$. There, we see that $1600 - x + x = 1681$, or $169$. This leaves us with $1600 = x + 169 \\Longrightarrow x = \\boxed{1431}$."
