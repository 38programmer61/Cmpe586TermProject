    "solution": "We could cross-multiply, but that looks terrifying.  Instead, we start by factoring each of the quadratics, hoping that we'll get some convenient cancellation.  Factoring each of the 4 quadratics gives  \\[\\frac{(r-4)(r-1)}{(r-7)(r-1)} = \\frac{(r-5)(r+3)}{(r-5)(r+4)}.\\]Canceling the common factors on each side gives us  \\[\\frac{r-4}{r-7} = \\frac{r+3}{r+4}.\\]Cross-multiplying gives $(r-4)(r+4) = (r+3)(r-7)$.  Expanding both sides gives $r^2 - 16 = r^2 - 4r - 21$.  Solving for $r$ gives $r=\\boxed{-5/4}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "For simplicity, we set $r^2=a$. Setting the given expression equal results in  $$\\frac{a-5a+4}{a-8a+7}=\\frac{a-2a-15}{a-a-20}.$$Combining like terms gives \\[\\frac{-4a+4}{-7a+7}=\\frac{-a-15}{-20}.\\]We know $-20\\neq0$ so we can cross multiply \\[-4a+4=(-7a+7)(-a-15).\\]Multiplying out gives \\[-4a+4=(7a-7)(a+15).\\]Expanding and collecting like terms again gives  \\[-4a+4=7a^2-92a-105.\\]Setting the expression equal to $0$ gives  \\[7a^2-88a-109=0.\\]Factoring an \"easy\" quadratic leaves \\[(a-11)(7a+10)=0.\\]Thus $a=11$ and $a=\\dfrac{-10}{7}$. Rewriting in terms of $r$ gives $r^2=11$ and $r^2=\\dfrac{-10}{7}.$ The first solution gives $r^2=11$ or $r=\\boxed{\\pm\\sqrt{11}}$. Notice that the second solution is extraneous."
