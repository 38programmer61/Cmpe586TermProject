    "problem": "Brenda is going from $(-4,5)$ to $(5,-4)$, but she needs to stop by the origin on the way. How far does she have to travel?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "There are two segments of Brenda's trip: from $(-4,5)$ to $(0,0)$, and from $(0,0)$ to $(5,-4)$. Using the distance formula, the total distance is  \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(-4-0)^2+(5-0)^2}&+\\sqrt{(5-0)^2+(-4-0)^2}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{16+25}+\\sqrt{25+16}\\\\\n&=\\boxed{2\\sqrt{41}}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Brenda needs to go from $(-4,5)$ to $(0,0)$ first, which is a distance of $\\sqrt{(-4-0)^2+(5-0)^2}=\\sqrt{16+25}=\\sqrt{41}$ units. Then, she needs to go from $(0,0)$ to $(5,-4)$, which is a distance of $\\sqrt{(5-0)^2+(-4-0)^2}=\\sqrt{25+16}=\\sqrt{41}$ units. So, the total distance Brenda has to travel is $2\\sqrt{41}$ units."
