    "problem": "A geometric sequence of positive integers is formed for which the first term is 3 and the fourth term is 192. What is the third term of the sequence?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the geometric sequence have common ratio $r$. We know that $3\\cdot r^3=192$, or $r=4$. Thus, the third term is $3 \\cdot r^2 = 3 \\cdot 4^2 = \\boxed{48}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the common ratio of the geometric sequence be $r$. We know that the first term is 3, so the second term is $3r$, the third term is $(3r)r = 3r^2$, and the fourth term is $(3r^2)r = 3r^3 = 192$. Dividing both sides of the equation $3r^3 = 192$ by 3, we get $r^3=64$. Since $4^3 = 64$, the common ratio $r=4$. Therefore, the third term of the sequence is $(3)(4^2) = \\boxed{48}$."
