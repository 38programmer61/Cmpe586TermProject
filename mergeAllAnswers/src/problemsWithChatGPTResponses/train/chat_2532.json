                "content": "Since Lisa needs to give each friend at least one marble, the first marble she gives to a friend does not affect the number of marbles she needs to give to the other friends. Thus, she needs to give the first friend 1 marble, the second friend 2 marbles, the third friend 3 marbles, and so on. The number of marbles needed to give to each friend forms an arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference 1.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: \nSum = (first term + last term) * number of terms / 2.\n\nThe last term of this sequence is the 10th term, which can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \nnth term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference.\n\nThe 10th term is 1 + (10 - 1) * 1 = 10.\n\nThus, the sum of the marbles needed is (1 + 10) * 10 / 2 = 55.\n\nSince Lisa already has 34 marbles, she needs an additional 55 - 34 = <<55-34=21>>21 marbles. Answer: \\boxed{21}.",
