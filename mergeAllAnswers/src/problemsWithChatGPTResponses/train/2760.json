    "problem": "The equation of the line that passes through the points $(-2,0)$ and $(0,2)$ can be expressed in the form $y=mx+b$. What is the value of $m+b$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since both of these points lie on the line, plugging them into the equation of the line will produce a true statement.  Thus $(-2, 0)$ gives us $0 = -2m + b$ and $(0, 2)$ gives us $2 = b$.  So we now know what $b$ is and can plug it back into the first equation to get $0 = -2m + 2$.  So $m = 1$ and $m + b = \\boxed{3}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The slope between the points $(x_1,y_1)=(-2,0)$ and $(x_2,y_2)=(0,2)$ is  $$m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} =\\frac{2-0}{0-(-2)}=\\frac{2}{2}=1$$ To find $b$, the y-intercept, we observe that when $x=0$, $y=m(0)+b=b.$ So, $b=y_2=m(0)+b=1+b\\Rightarrow b=2.$ Hence $m+b=1+2=\\boxed{3}$."
