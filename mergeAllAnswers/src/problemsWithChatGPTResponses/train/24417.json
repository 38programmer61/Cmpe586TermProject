    "problem": "At the beginning of my bike ride I feel good, so I can travel   20 miles per hour.  Later, I get tired and travel only 12 miles  per hour.  If I travel a total of 122 miles in a total time of   8 hours, for how many hours did I feel good?  Express your  answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "Let $x$ equal the number of hours that you felt good riding.  Then, $x$ hours were spent traveling at 20 mph, and $8-x$ hours were spent traveling at 12 mph.  During this time, a total of 122 miles was traveled.  Remembering that $d=r\\cdot t$, we can add the two distances, set this equal to 122 miles, and solve for $x$ as shown: \\begin{align*}\n20(x)+12(8-x)&=122\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 20x+96-12x&=122\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 8x&=26\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=26/8=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{4}}\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let $h$ denote the number of hours that I feel good. Since I travel at a rate of 20 miles per hour for $h$ hours, I travel $20h$ miles in that time. Since I travel at a rate of 12 miles per hour for $8-h$ hours, I travel $12(8-h)$ miles in that time. Since I travel a total of 122 miles in all, we have $$20h + 12(8-h) = 122.$$ Expanding the right side and simplifying gives $4h = 122 - 96 = 26$, from which dividing by $4$ gives $h = \\boxed{\\frac{13}{2}}$."
