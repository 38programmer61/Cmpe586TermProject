                "content": "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$. We are given that $x+y=25$. Simplifying, we find $y=25-x$. We are also given that the product of the two numbers is 126. Substituting $y$ in terms of $x$, we have $xy=126$. Substituting $25-x$ for $y$, we have $x(25-x)=126$. Expanding the left side, we have $-x^2+25x=126$. Rearranging and factoring, we have $x^2-25x+126=0$. Factoring this quadratic, we have $(x-9)(x-14)=0$. Therefore, $x=9$ or $x=14$. If $x=9$, then $y=25-9=16$. If $x=14$, then $y=25-14=11$. The absolute difference between $9$ and $16$ is $|9-16|=\\boxed{7}$, and the absolute difference between $14$ and $11$ is $|14-11|=\\boxed{3}$. Note that the absolute value of a difference is always positive.",
