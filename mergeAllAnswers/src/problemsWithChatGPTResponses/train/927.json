    "problem": "What is the area enclosed by the region defined by the equation $x^2+y^2+12x+16y=0$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We complete the square on the quadratic in $x$ by adding $(12/2)^2=36$ to both sides, and complete the square on the quadratic in $y$ by adding $(16/2)^2=64$ to both sides. We have the equation  \\[(x^2+12x+36)+(y^2+16y+64)=100 \\Rightarrow (x+6)^2+(y+8)^2=100\\]We see that this is the equation of a circle with center $(-6,-8)$ and radius 10. Thus, the area of the region enclosed by this circle is $\\pi \\cdot 10^2=\\boxed{100\\pi}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Completing the square, we get \\[(x^2+12x)+(y^2+16y)=0.\\]We \"complete the square\" in the $x$ terms by adding $(12/2)^2=36$ to both sides, and \"complete the square\" in the $y$ terms by adding $(16/2)^2=64$ to both sides.  This gives us \\begin{align*}\n(x^2+12x+36)+(y^2+16y+64)&=100 \\\\\n(x+6)^2+(y+8)^2&=100.\n\\end{align*}Thus, the equation describes a circle in the $xy$-plane with radius $\\sqrt{100}=10.$  The area of this circle is $\\pi (10)^2=\\boxed{100\\pi}.$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.4 cm);\n\ndraw(Circle((-6,-8),10),red);\n\ndot(\"$(-6,-8)$\", (-6,-8), SW);\n[/asy]"
