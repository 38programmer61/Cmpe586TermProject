    "problem": "I have a bag with blue marbles and yellow marbles in it. At the moment, the ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is 8:5. If I remove 12 blue marbles and add 21 yellow marbles, the ratio will be 1:3. How many blue marbles were in the bag before I removed some?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of blue marbles and $y$ the number of yellow marbles before I added more. We are given that the ratio of blue to yellow is 8:5, so $\\dfrac{x}{y}=\\dfrac{8}{5}$. Additionally, after we remove blue marbles and add yellow marbles the total number of blue marbles and yellow marbles will be $x-12$ and $y+21$ respectively. We're given that at this point the ratio will be $1:3$, so $\\dfrac{x-12}{y+21}=\\dfrac{1}{3}$. Cross multiplying the first equation gives $5x=8y$ and cross multiplying the second gives $3(x-12)=1(y+21)$. Solving two linear equations on two variables is routine; we get the solution $y=15$, $x=24$. Since $x$ represents the number of blue marbles before some were removed, the answer to the problem is just $\\boxed{24}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let's start by assuming that the number of blue marbles in the bag before removing any is 8x, and the number of yellow marbles is 5x.\nAfter removing 12 blue marbles, we have 8x - 12 blue marbles.\nAfter adding 21 yellow marbles, we have 5x + 21 yellow marbles.\nNow, we have the following ratio: (8x - 12) : (5x + 21) = 1 : 3.\nCross multiplying, we get 3(8x - 12) = (5x + 21).\nExpanding the brackets, we get 24x - 36 = 5x + 21.\nSubtracting 5x from both sides, we get 19x - 36 = 21.\nAdding 36 to both sides, we get 19x = 57.\nDividing both sides by 19, we get x = 3.\nTherefore, there were 8x = 8(3) = <<8*3=24>>24 blue marbles in the bag before removing any. Answer: \\boxed{24}."
