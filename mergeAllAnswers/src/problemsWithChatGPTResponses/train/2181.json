    "solution": "We solve each inequality independently: $$\n\\begin{array}{r r r@{~}c@{~}l}\n(1) && -3y &\\ge & y+7 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow & -4y &\\ge & 7 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow & y &\\le & -\\frac{7}{4}\n\\end{array}\n$$ (Notice that when we divide by $-4,$ we must reverse the direction of the inequality. We must do the same thing whenever we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number.) $$\n\\begin{array}{r r r@{~}c@{~}l}\n(2) && -2y &\\le & 12 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow & y &\\ge & -6\n\\end{array}\n$$ $$\n\\begin{array}{r r r@{~}c@{~}l}\n(3) && -4y &\\ge & 2y+17 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow & -6y &\\ge & 17 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow & y &\\le & -\\frac{17}{6}\n\\end{array}\n$$ Inequalities $(1)$ and $(3)$ set upper bounds on $y,$ with $(3)$ setting the stronger bound; the largest integer satisfying these bounds is $-3.$ Inequality $(2)$ sets a lower bound on $y;$ the smallest integer satisfying that bound is $-6.$ In all, there are $\\boxed{4}$ integers satisfying the three inequalities: $-6,$ $-5,$ $-4,$ and $-3.$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We solve each inequality separately.\n\nFor the first inequality, we have $-3y \\geq y+7$. Adding $3y$ to both sides gives $0 \\geq 4y+7$. Subtracting 7 from both sides gives $-7 \\geq 4y$. Dividing both sides by 4 gives $-\\dfrac{7}{4} \\geq y$. Since $y$ must be an integer, the possible values of $y$ are $-\\dfrac{7}{4}$, $-2$, $-1$, 0, 1, 2, $\\ldots$. However, since we must also have $-\\dfrac{7}{4} \\geq y$, we conclude that the only possible values of $y$ are $-\\dfrac{7}{4}$, $-2$, $-1$, and 0. These 4 values work, so there are $\\boxed{4}$ solutions to this inequality.\n\nFor the second inequality, we have $-2y \\leq 12$. Dividing both sides by $-2$ gives $y \\geq -6$. Since $y$ must be an integer, the possible values of $y$ are $-6$, $-5$, $-4$, $\\ldots$. However, since we must also have $y \\geq -6$, we conclude that the only possible values of $y$ are $-6$, $-5$, $-4$, $\\ldots$, 0, 1, 2, $\\ldots$. There are infinitely many solutions to this inequality.\n\nFor the third inequality, we have $-4y \\geq 2y+17$. Adding $4y$ to both sides gives $0 \\geq 6y+17$. Subtracting 17 from both sides gives $-17 \\geq 6y$. Dividing both sides by 6 gives $-\\dfrac{17}{6} \\geq y$. Since $y$ must be an integer, the possible values of $y$ are $-\\dfrac{17}{6}$, $-3$, $-2$, $-1$, 0, 1, $\\ldots$. However, since we must also have $-\\dfrac{17}{6} \\geq y$, we conclude that the only possible values of $y$ are $-\\dfrac{17}{6}$, $-3$, $-2$, $-1$, and 0. These 5 values work, so there are $\\boxed{5}$ solutions to this inequality.\n\nTo find the solutions that are common to all three inequalities, we must find the values that satisfy all three inequalities. The values that work must satisfy $-\\dfrac{7}{4} \\geq y$, $y \\geq -6$, and $-\\dfrac{17}{6} \\geq y$. The only value that satisfies all three inequalities is $y = \\boxed{-2}$."
