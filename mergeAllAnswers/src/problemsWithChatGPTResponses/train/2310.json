    "problem": "Solve the equation $27 = 3(9)^{x-1}$ for $x.$",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Dividing both sides by 3, we quickly note that $ 9 = 9^{x-1} \\rightarrow 1 = x-1 \\rightarrow x = \\boxed{2}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since $9=3^2$, $9^x=(3^2)^x=3^{2x}$. Our equation is now $27=3\\cdot 3^{2x-2}$, so we can write $$27 = 3\\cdot 3^{2x-2} = 3^{1+2x-2} = 3^{2x-1}.$$Thus we must have $2x-1=3$, or $2x=4$, or $x=\\boxed{2}$."
