                "content": "We are given that $y = -16t^2 + 80t$ and we want to find the value of $t$ such that $y = 36$. So, we set $-16t^2 + 80t = 36$ and subtract $36$ from both sides to obtain $-16t^2 + 80t - 36 = 0$. We can divide the equation by $4$ to simplify the equation to $-4t^2 + 20t - 9 = 0$. Factoring the quadratic or applying the quadratic formula gives us $(t-1.5)(4t-6) = 0$. So, either $t-1.5 = 0$ or $4t-6=0$. Solving each equation gives us $t = 1.5$ or $t = 1.5$. The \"first\" time $y$ is equal to $36$ is $t = \\boxed{1.5}$.",
