    "problem": "Let $A$ and $B$ be real numbers such that $\\frac{A}{x-5}+B(x+1)=\\frac{-3x^2+12x+22}{x-5}$. What is $A+B$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We want to break up the rational function on the right into a polynomial and a term with constant numerator. To do this, we notice that $-3x^2+15x$ is a multiple of $x-5$, hence\n\\[\\frac{-3x^2+12x+22}{x-5}=\\frac{-3x^2+15x-15x+12x+22}{x - 5}=-3x+\\frac{-3x+22}{x-5}.\\]Now notice that $-3x+15$ is also a multiple of $x-5$, so\n\\[-3x+\\frac{-3x+22}{x-5}=-3x+\\frac{-3x+15+7}{x-5}=-3x-3+\\frac{7}{x-5}.\\]Thus $B=-3$ and $A=7$, so $A+B=\\boxed{4}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "By multiplying out the right side of the equation, we have $\\frac{A}{x-5}+B(x+1)=\\frac{A+Bx+B}{x-5}=\\frac{-3x^2+12x+22}{x-5}$.  There is a common factor of $x-5$ in the numerator and denominator on the right side of the equation, so we can multiply both sides by $x-5$ to eliminate fractions. This gives $A+Bx+B=-3x^2+12x+22$.  Equating coefficients of like terms, this gives a system of three equations: $B=-3$, $A+B=12$, and $B=22$.  Then $A=12+3=15$ and $B=-3$.  So the answer is $A+B=15+(-3)=\\boxed{12}$."
