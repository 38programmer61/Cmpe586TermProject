    "problem": "Factor $58x^5-203x^{11}$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $58=2\\cdot29$ and $203=7\\cdot29$, we can factor a $29x^5$ from the expression, to get $$58x^5-203x^{11}=\\boxed{-29x^5(7x^6-2)}.$$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "First, we look for the greatest common factor of the two terms. Both terms have a factor of $x^5$, so we can factor out $x^5$ to get  \\begin{align*}\n58x^5-203x^{11} &= x^5(58-203x^6)\\\\\n&= x^5(-203x^6+58)\\\\\n&= \\boxed{-x^5(203x^6-58)}.\n\\end{align*}"
