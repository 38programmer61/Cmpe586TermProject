Since we want to avoid having any two friends receive the same number of coins, we need to distribute the coins in a way that each friend receives a different number of coins.\n\nThe minimum number of coins will be obtained by giving the first friend 1 coin, the second friend 2 coins, the third friend 3 coins, and so on, until the twelfth friend receives 12 coins. This distribution requires us to use the sum of the first 12 positive integers:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 78\n\nSince Alex currently has 63 coins, he needs 78 - 63 = <<78-63=15>>15 more coins in order to give each of his friends at least one coin and no two friends receive the same number of coins.",
