    "problem": "Given that a rectangle with length $3x$ inches and width $x + 5$ inches has the property that its area and perimeter have equal values, what is $x$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $l$ represent the length of the rectangle and $w$ represent the width so that $l = 3x$ and $w = x + 5$. Since the area of the rectangle equals its perimeter, we have that $l \\times w = 2l + 2w$. We can then substitute $3x$ back in for $l$ and $x + 5$ in for $w$ to get  \\begin{align*}\n& (3x)(x+5) = 2(3x) + 2(x + 5) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad & 3x^2 + 15x = 6x + 2x + 10 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad & 3x^2 + 7x - 10 = 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad & (x - 1)(3x + 10) = 0.\n\\end{align*}Solving this equation, we get that the two possible values of $x$ are $x = 1$ and $x = - \\frac{10}{3}$. However, both the length $3x$ and the width $x + 5$ must be positive, so the only solution is $x = \\boxed{1}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "For a rectangle with length $l$ and width $w$, the area is $lw$ and the perimeter is $2(l + w)$. The area and the perimeter are equal, so we have $lw = 2(l + w)$.\n\nSubstituting $3x$ for $l$ and $x + 5$ for $w$, we have $(3x)(x + 5) = 2((3x) + (x + 5))$. Expandsing both sides gives $3x^2 + 15x = 8x + 10$.\n\nCombining like terms gives $3x^2 + 7x - 10 = 0$. This quadratic factors into $(3x - 2)(x + 5) = 0$, so either $3x - 2 = 0$ or $x + 5 = 0$.\n\nIf $3x - 2 = 0$, then $x = \\frac23$. However, if $x + 5 = 0$, then $x = -5$. $-5$ is an extraneous solution since we need the dimensions to be positive.\n\nTherefore, the value $x = \\boxed{\\frac23}$ of the length of the rectangle is a correct solution."
