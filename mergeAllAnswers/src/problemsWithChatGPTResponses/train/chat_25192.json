Since the area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width, $x(x+5)$ represents the area of the larger rectangle. In other words, $x(x+5)$ represents the area of the large rectangle with the hole cut out of it. The area of the hole itself is $(2x-3)(x-2)$. Thus, the area of the large rectangle is $x(x+5) + 7(x+5) = \\boxed{x^2 + 12x+35}$.",
