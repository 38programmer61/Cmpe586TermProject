                "content": "Let $f$ be the flat fee for the first night and let $r$ be the additional amount charged per night. Then the total bill for George is $f+2r$ and the total bill for Noah is $f+5r$. Because George;s bill was $\\$155$ and Noah's bill was $\\$290$, we have \\begin{align*}\nf+2r &= 155\\quad\\text{and}\\\\\nf+5r &= 290.\n\\end{align*}Multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting the second equation gives  \\begin{align*}\n2f+4r-\\left(f+5r\\right) &= 310-290\\\\\nf- r &=20.\n\\end{align*}Replacing $f$ in terms of $r$ in the equation $f+2r=155$ gives $(r+20) +2r=155$,  which reduces to $3r=135$ and, $r=45$. Replacing $r$ by 45 in the equation $f-r=20$ gives $f=65$. Thus, the flat fee is $\\boxed{65}$ dollars.",
