    "problem": "A non-square rectangle has integer dimensions. The number  of square units in its area is numerically equal to the number of units in its perimeter. What is the number of units in the perimeter of this rectangle?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the two sides of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$.  The problem is now telling us $ab=2a+2b$.  Putting everything on one side of the equation, we have $ab-2a-2b=0.$  This looks tricky.  However, we can add a number to both sides of the equation to make it factor nicely.  4 works here:  $$ab-2a-2b+4=4 \\Rightarrow (a-2)(b-2)=4$$Since we don't have a square, $a$ and $b$ must be different.  It doesn't matter which one is which, so we can just say $a=6 $ and $b=3 $.  The perimeter is then $2(6+3)=\\boxed{18}$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the dimensions of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$ with $l < w$. The area of the rectangle is $lw$ and the perimeter is $2l + 2w$. Setting the two equal gives $lw = 2l + 2w$. Dividing by $2lw$ gives $\\frac{1}{w} + \\frac{1}{l} = \\frac{1}{2}$, where $w$ and $l$ are integers. This expression rearranges to $2w + 2l = wl$. The left side of this equation is even, so $wl$ is even as well. Thus, at least one of $w$ and $l$ is even. Without loss of generality, let $l$ be even. Then $l$ is at least 2, and dividing by 2 in the equation above gives $w + l = \\frac{wl}{2}$. Since $l$ and $w$ are positive integers, $w + l$ must be strictly greater than $\\frac{wl}{2}$. However, this contradicts the given, so there are $\\boxed{0}$ non-square rectangles that satisfy the given. The rectangle of length 0 and width 0 is not considered a valid rectangle."
