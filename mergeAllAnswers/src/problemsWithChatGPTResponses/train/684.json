    "solution": "Since 29 is not a perfect square, we know that $\\sqrt{29}$ cannot equal an integer. Therefore, $f(\\sqrt{29})=\\lfloor\\sqrt{29}\\rfloor+5=5+5=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The name of this function is not $f(x)$. It is $f$. We are asked to find $f(\\sqrt{29})$. Since $\\sqrt{29}$ is not an integer, we use the second case to find $f(\\sqrt{29}) = \\lfloor\\sqrt{29}\\rfloor+5 = \\boxed{8}.$"
