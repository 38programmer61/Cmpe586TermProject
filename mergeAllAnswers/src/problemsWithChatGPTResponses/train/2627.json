    "problem": "Let $C$ be the circle with equation $x^2+2y-9=-y^2+18x+9$. If $(a,b)$ is the center of $C$ and $r$ is its radius, what is the value of $a+b+r$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can rewrite the equation $x^2+2y-9=-y^2+18x+9$ as $x^2-18x+y^2+2y=18$. Completing the square, we have $(x-9)^2-81+(y+1)^2-1=18$, or $(x-9)^2+(y+1)^2=100$. This is the equation of a circle of radius $r=10$ and with center $(a,b)=(9,-1)$. Therefore, $a+b+r=9+-1+10=\\boxed{18}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We move all the terms to the left side to get \\[x^2-18x+y^2+2y=0.\\]We complete the square by adding and subtracting the appropriate constants to both sides. Separating the $x$ and $y$ terms while keeping the constant $0$ on the right side, we get\n\n$\\begin{aligned}x^2-18x+y^2+2y&=0 \\\\ (x^2-18x) + (y^2+2y) &= 0.\\end{aligned}$Completing the square on $x,$ we add $(18/2)^2 = 81$ to both sides. Completing the square on $y,$ we add $(2/2)^2 = 1$ to both sides. The equation becomes\n\\[\\begin{aligned}(x^2-18x + 81) + (y^2+2y+1) &= 82 \\\\ (x-9)^2 + (y+1)^2 &= 82, \\end{aligned}\\]so the center is $(a,b) = (9,-1),$ with radius $\\sqrt{82}.$ Thus, $a + b + r = 9 + (-1) + \\sqrt{82} = \\boxed{8 + \\sqrt{82}}.$"
