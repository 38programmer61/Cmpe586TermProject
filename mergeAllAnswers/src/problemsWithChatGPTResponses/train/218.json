    "solution": "We begin by looking at each of the two possible cases; either $x<2$ and $f(x)=9x+16=-2$, or $x\\ge2$ and $f(x)=2x-14=-2$. Tackling the first case, we find that if $9x+16=-2$, then $x=-\\frac{18}{9}=-2$. Since this also satisfies the condition $x<2$, this is our first possible value of $x$. In the second case, we see that if $2x-14=-2$, then $x=\\frac{12}{2}=6$. Since this also satisfies the condition $x\\ge2$, this is our second possible value for $x$. The sum of these two values is just $-2+6=\\boxed{4}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "If $x < 2$, then $f(x) = 9x+16 = -2$, so $9x = -18$, and $x = -2$. However, this value of $x$ is not less than 2, so it is extraneous.\n\nIf $x \\ge 2$, then $f(x) = 2x-14 = -2$, so $2x = 12$, and $x = 6$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of $x$ is $-2 + 6 = \\boxed{4}$."
