Therefore, the amount of money that Frederick will have is the principal, $P$, multiplied by one plus the interest rate, $r$, compounded $n$ times a year, raised to the power of $nt$, where $n$ is the number of times a year the interest is compounded, and $t$ is the number of years the money is invested for.  Hence, at the age of $18$, Frederick will have a total of $\\$2000\\left(1+\\dfrac{.05}{1}\\right)^{1\\cdot 18}$ dollars.  Evaluating this expression, we find the amount to be $\\$2000(1.05)^{18} = 2000(1.05^{10.5})\\approx \\boxed{\\$5997.36}$.",
