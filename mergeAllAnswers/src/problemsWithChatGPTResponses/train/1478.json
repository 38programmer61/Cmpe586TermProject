    "problem": "If $9s+5t=108$ and $s$ is two less than $t$, what is $t$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First we begin by solving the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n9s+5t&=108, \\\\\nt-2&=s.\n\\end{align*}Making the substitution for $s$ from the second equation to the first, we get $9(t-2)+5t=108$, which simplifies to $14t-18=108$. Solving for $t$, we find that $t=\\frac{108+18}{14}=\\boxed{9}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Substituting $t=s+2$ into the first equation we have $9s+5(s+2)=108$. This gives $14s+10=108$. Subtracting $10$ from both sides of the equation results in $14s=98$. Thus, $s=7$. Substituting $s=7$ into the equation $t=s+2$ gives us $t=7+2=\\boxed{9}$."
