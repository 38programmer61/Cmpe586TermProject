    "problem": "If $2^8=16^x$, find $x$.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can write $16$ as $2^4$. Therefore, we can write our equation as $2^8 = 2^{4 \\cdot x}$. Solving, we get that $x = \\boxed{2}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We could take logarithms to solve the problem, but because the bases are so nice (powers of $2$ and $16$, which happen to be powers of $2^4$) we can simplify \"by inspection.\"  Writing the equation $2^8=16^x$ in terms of powers of $2$ gives us $2^8=(2^4)^x=2^{4x}$, so $2^8=2^{4x}$.  We see that $x=\\boxed{2}$."
