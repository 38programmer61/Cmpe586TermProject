    "problem": "Three faucets fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes.  How long, in seconds, does it take six faucets to fill a 25-gallon tub?  Assume that all faucets dispense water at the same rate.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since three faucets can fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes, six can do it twice as fast, i.e. 3 minutes.  Additionally, the tub is a quarter the size and thus it will be filled four times as fast which gives $3/4$ minutes or $\\boxed{45}$ seconds.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Three faucets fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes, so each faucet fills at a rate of 100/3=<<100/3=33.33>>33.33 gallons per minute.\nThus, each faucet fills at a rate of 33.33/60=0.56 gallons per second.\nSince six faucets fill the tub at the same rate, they fill it at a rate of 6*0.56=<<6*0.56=3.36>>3.36 gallons per second.\nTherefore, it takes six faucets 25/3.36=7.44 seconds to fill a 25-gallon tub. Answer: \\boxed{7.44}."
