                "content": "Since the line containing $(6,8)$, $(-2,k)$, and $(-10,4)$ is a straight line, we can find the slope of this line by finding the slope of any two of these three points. Choosing $(6,8)$ and $(-2,k)$ as the two points, we find that the slope is $\\frac{8-k}{6-(-2)}=\\frac{8-k}{8}=\\frac{4-k}{4}$. Since this slope is the same as the slope between the points $(-2,k)$ and $(-10,4)$, the slope of this line is also $\\frac{4-k}{4}$. Setting this equal to the slope between the points $(6,8)$ and $(-10,4)$, we have that $\\frac{4-k}{4}=\\frac{8-4}{6-(-10)}=\\frac{4}{16}$. Algebraic manipulation shows that $\\frac{4-k}{4}=\\frac{4}{16}=\\frac{1}{4}$, so $4-k=4$. Thus, $k=4-4=\\boxed{0}$.",
