    "problem": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the two distinct solutions to the equation $$(x-3)(x+3) = 21x - 63.$$If $p > q$, what is the value of $p - q$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Factoring the right side, we can see that $(x-3)(x+3) = 21(x-3)$. Simplifying, we have $(x-3)(x+3) - 21(x-3) = (x-3)(x-18),$ and therefore our $p$ and $q$ are 18 and 3. Therefore, $p - q = \\boxed{15}.$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "First, we expand the product on the left-side of the equation: \\begin{align*}\n(x-3)(x+3) &= 21x - 63.\n\\end{align*}Simplifying the left side, we have \\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 9 &= 21x - 63.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting $21x-63$ from each side, we get \\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 21x + 54 &= 0.\n\\end{align*}Factoring the quadratic, we have \\begin{align*}\n(x - 3)(x- 18) &= 0.\n\\end{align*}Thus, $x=3$ is one solution and $x=18$ is another.  Since $p>q$, we conclude that $p=18$ and $q=3$. Therefore the answer is $p-q= \\boxed{15}$."
