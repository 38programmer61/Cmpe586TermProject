                "content": "Let $h$ denote the number of hours that I feel good. Since I travel at a rate of 20 miles per hour for $h$ hours, I travel $20h$ miles in that time. Since I travel at a rate of 12 miles per hour for $8-h$ hours, I travel $12(8-h)$ miles in that time. Since I travel a total of 122 miles in all, we have $$20h + 12(8-h) = 122.$$ Expanding the right side and simplifying gives $4h = 122 - 96 = 26$, from which dividing by $4$ gives $h = \\boxed{\\frac{13}{2}}$.",
