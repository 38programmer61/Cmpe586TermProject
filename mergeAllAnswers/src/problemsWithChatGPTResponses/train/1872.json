    "problem": "While watching a circus show, I counted out the number of acrobats and elephants. I counted 40 legs and 15 heads. How many acrobats did I see in the show?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the number of acrobats in the show be $a$ and the number of elephants be $e$. We are looking for the value of $a$. Assuming that each acrobat has 2 legs and 1 head, and that each elephant has 4 legs and 1 head, we can set up the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2a+4e &= 40 \\\\\na + e &= 15 \\\\\n\\end{align*}To solve for $a$, we need to eliminate $e$ from the equations above. We can rewrite the second equation above as $e=15-a$, and substituting this into the first equation to eliminate $e$ gives $2a+4(15-a) = 40$, or $a=10$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{10}$ acrobats in the circus show.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let's assume the number of acrobats is A and the number of elephants is E.\nEach acrobat has 2 legs, so the total number of legs contributed by acrobats is 2A.\nEach elephant has 4 legs, so the total number of legs contributed by elephants is 4E.\nFrom the information given, we know that the total number of legs is 40, so we can write the equation 2A + 4E = 40.\nWe also know that the total number of heads is 15, so we can write the equation A + E = 15.\nWe can solve this system of equations by substituting A = 15 - E into the first equation:\n2(15 - E) + 4E = 40\n30 - 2E + 4E = 40\n2E = 10\nE = 5\nSubstituting this value back into the equation A + E = 15:\nA + 5 = 15\nA = 10\nTherefore, you saw 10 acrobats in the show. Answer: \\boxed{10}."
