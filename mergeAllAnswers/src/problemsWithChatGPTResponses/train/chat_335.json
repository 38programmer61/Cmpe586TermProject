                "content": "We have $\\frac{p}{q} = \\frac{1}{10}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $p$, we have $\\frac{p}{q} \\cdot p = \\frac{1}{10} \\cdot p$, which implies $\\frac{p^2}{q} = \\frac{p}{10}$. Since $\\frac{p}{n} = 3$, multiplying both sides of this equation by $p$, we have $\\frac{p}{n} \\cdot p = 3 \\cdot p$, which implies $\\frac{p^2}{n} = 3p$. Since $\\frac{m}{n} = 15$, multiplying both sides of this equation by $\\frac{p}{3}$, we have $\\frac{m}{n} \\cdot \\frac{p}{3} = 15 \\cdot \\frac{p}{3}$, which implies $\\frac{m \\cdot p}{3n} = 5p$. Squaring both sides of this equation, we have $\\left(\\frac{m \\cdot p}{3n}\\right)^2 = (5p)^2$, which simplifies to $\\frac{(m \\cdot p)^2}{(3n)^2} = 25p^2$. Applying the property of reciprocal cancellation, we have $\\frac{m^2}{9n^2} = 25p$, which implies $m^2 = 225n^2 = (15n)^2$. Applying the property of reciprocal cancellation again, we have $m = \\frac{(15n)}{3}$. Hence, $\\frac{m}{q} = \\frac{\\frac{(15n)}{3}}{q} = \\frac{15n}{3q} = \\boxed{5} \\cdot \\frac{n}{q} = 5 \\cdot \\frac{m}{p}$.",
