    "problem": "The product of two consecutive page numbers is $18{,}360.$ What is the sum of the two page numbers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the page numbers be $n$ and $n + 1.$ Then, the problem can be modeled by the equation $n(n+1) = 18360.$ We can rewrite the equation as $n^2 + n - 18360=0.$\n\nNow using the quadratic formula, we find that $$n = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4\\cdot 18360}}{2}.$$ So, $n = 135.$ Hence, $n + (n + 1) = \\boxed{271}.$\n\nThis equation can be factored as well, but that would not save much time. The best way to solve this quickly would be to notice that $18360$ falls between $135^2=18225$ and $136^2=18496,$ so since we know that $n$ is an integer, we can guess that $n = 135.$ Plugging it back into the equation, we see that it works, so $n + (n + 1) = \\boxed{271}.$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the two consecutive page numbers be $n$ and $n + 1.$ Then we have the equation $$n(n + 1) = 18{,}360.$$We can write $18{,}360 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19.$ To make the left-hand side into this factorization, we look for factors of $n$ that are one less than $n + 1$ (since then, when we multiply, we will get one factor of $n,$ and one factor of $n + 1$). Checking potential factors starting with $n = 2,$ we find that $n = 170.$\n\nTherefore, the two consecutive page numbers are $170$ and $170 + 1 = 171.$ Their sum is $170 + 171 = \\boxed{341}.$\n\nIndeed, notice that $341 = 11^3.$"
