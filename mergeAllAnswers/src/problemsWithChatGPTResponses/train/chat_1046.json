Since the common difference between consecutive terms is $d$, the $13^{\\text{th}}$ term is $a_1 + 12d$.  Setting this equal to $29$, we have  \\[a_1 + 12d = 29.\\]Since $a_1 = 5$, we have $5 + 12d = 29$, so $12d = 24$ and $d = 2$.  Therefore, the $50^{\\text{th}}$ term is $a_1 + 49d = 5 + 49 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{103}$.",
