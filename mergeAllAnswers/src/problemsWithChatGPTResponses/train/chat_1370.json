                "content": "Since \"It takes four painters working at the same rate 1.25 work-days to finish a job,\" we know that these four painters together can complete $1$ job in $1.25$ days. Thus, in $1$ day, they can complete $\\frac{1}{1.25}=\\frac{4}{5}$ of the job, and so each of the four painters contribute $\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\frac{4}{5}=\\frac{1}{5}$ the job in one day.\n\nIn one day, three painters will contribute $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot3=\\frac{3}{5}$ of the job. Thus, we need $\\frac{5}{3}$ days for three workers to complete the job. But $\\frac{5}{3}=1\\frac{2}{3}$, which we recognize as the answer.\n\nFor a more intuitive solution, suppose the painters are invisible workers in Santa's \"Hoarder\" Warehouse, and that they paint $100$ identical chairs. When four painters are present, each will finish $\\frac{100}{4}=25$ chairs in a day. The three of them who show up will paint $75$ chairs on that day. Thus, it will take two days for three painters to complete the work with an average rate of $37.5\\%$ that of the four-worker crew.",
