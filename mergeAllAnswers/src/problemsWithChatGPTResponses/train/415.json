    "problem": "If $64^5 = 32^x$, what is the value of $2^{-x}$?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Noticing that both 64 and 32 are powers of 2, we can rewrite the expression as $\\left(2^6\\right)^5=\\left( 2^5 \\right) ^x$. Simplifying, we get \\begin{align*}\n\\left(2^6\\right)^5&=\\left( 2^5 \\right) ^x \\\\\n2^{6 \\cdot 5} &= 2^{5 \\cdot x} \\\\\n2^{30} &= 2^{5x} \\\\\n2^6&=2^x \\\\\n2^{-6} &= 2^{-x}\n\\end{align*} Thus, $2^{-6}=\\frac{1}{2^6}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since $64$ equals $2^6$, $64^5$ equals $(2^6)^5=2^{30}$.  Similarly, looking at the right side of the equation, $32$ equals $2^5$, and so $32^x = (2^5)^x = 2^{5x}$.  We set these two things equal to one another: $2^{30} = 2^{5x}$.  To solve, we could take the base-2 logarithms of both sides, but with an equation this simple, we do not have to.  The only way the bases are equal but the exponents not equal is for the exponents to be equal: $30=5x$.  Solving this equation gives us $x=6$.  Hence $2^{-x} = \\boxed{\\frac1{2^x} = \\frac{1}{2^6} = \\frac{1}{64}}$."
