    "problem": "A rectangular room measures 12-feet by 6-feet. How many square yards of carpet are needed to cover the floor of the room?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The area of the room is $(12\\text{ ft.}) (6\\text{ ft.})=72$ square feet.  Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, 1 square yard equals 9 square feet.  Therefore, $72/9=\\boxed{8}$ square yards are needed to cover the floor.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "To find the area of the rectangular room, we multiply the length by the width: \n\n12 feet * 6 feet = <<12*6=72>>72 square feet\n\nSince there are 9 square feet in a square yard, we divide the area in square feet by 9: \n\n72 / 9 = <<72/9=8>>8 square yards\n\nTherefore, 8 square yards of carpet are needed to cover the floor of the room."
