    "solution": "We have $3 \\text{ ft} = 1 \\text{ yd}$. Cubing both sides, we get $27 \\text{ ft}^3 = 1 \\text{ yd}^3$. So there are $\\boxed{27}$ cubic feet in one cubic yard.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "To find the number of cubic feet in one cubic yard, we need to determine the volume of one cubic yard and then convert that volume into cubic feet.\n\nSince one yard is equal to three feet, the length, width, and height of one cubic yard would each be equal to three feet. The volume of a cube is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height. Therefore, the volume of one cubic yard is equal to:\n\nVolume = length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height\n= 3 feet \u00d7 3 feet \u00d7 3 feet\n= 27 cubic feet\n\nTherefore, there are 27 cubic feet in one cubic yard."
