    "problem": "What is the ordered pair of integers $(x,y)$ for which $12x + 21y = 15$ and $21x + 12y = 51$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Simplify both equations by dividing by 3: \\begin{align*}\n4x + 7y &= 5 \\\\\n7x + 4y &= 17.\n\\end{align*} We solve this system using the elimination method.  Multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by $-4$ to obtain \\begin{align*}\n28x + 49y &= 35 \\\\\n-28x -16y &= -68.\n\\end{align*} Adding the equations gives $33y=-33$, so $y=-1$.  Substituting $y=-1$ into either equation and solving, we get $x=3$.  Therefore, $(x,y)=\\boxed{(3,-1)}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Adding twice the first equation to three times the second, we find that $66x+66y=123$.  Dividing both sides by 66, we have $x+y=\\frac{123}{66}$.  We subtract the second equation from the first and divide by 9 to find that $x-y=-2$.  Adding these two equations, we find that $2x=\\frac{123}{66}-2=\\frac{41}{22}$.  Subtracting these two equations, we find that $2y=2- \\frac{41}{22}=\\frac{3}{22}$.  Dividing by 2 we find that $y=\\frac{3}{44}$.  Thus $y=\\frac{3}{44}$ and $x=y+2=\\frac{91}{44}$, giving our solution $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{91}{44},\\frac{3}{44}\\right)}$."
