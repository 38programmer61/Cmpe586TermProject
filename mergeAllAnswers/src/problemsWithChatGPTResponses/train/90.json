    "problem": "Mark and Sandy are walking to the convenience store at the midpoint of their coordinates. Mark is standing at $(0,7)$, and Sandy is standing at $(-4,-1)$. At what coordinate will they meet?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The coordinate at which the two will meet is the midpoint of the two given coordinates. We apply the midpoint formula to find $$\\left(\\frac{-4+0}{2},\\frac{-1+7}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{(-2,3)}.$$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The midpoint of their coordinates will be the average of their $x$-coordinates and the average of their $y$-coordinates. The average of their $x$-coordinates is $\\frac{0+(-4)}{2}=-2$, and the average of their $y$-coordinates is $\\frac{7+(-1)}{2}=3$. Therefore, they will meet at $\\boxed{(-2,3)}$."
