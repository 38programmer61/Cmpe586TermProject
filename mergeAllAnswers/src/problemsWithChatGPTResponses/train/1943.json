    "solution": "We have $(90 + 5)^2 = 90^2 + 2(90)(5) + 5^2 = 8100 + 900 + 25 = \\boxed{9025}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "To compute $95^2$ in my head, I can square the difference between $95$ and $100$ and then subtract this result from $100^2$. \n\nThe difference between $95$ and $100$ is $100-95=5$, so squaring this result gives $5^2=25$. \n\nThen, subtracting this result from $100^2=10,000$, we have $10,000-25=\\boxed{9,975}$."
