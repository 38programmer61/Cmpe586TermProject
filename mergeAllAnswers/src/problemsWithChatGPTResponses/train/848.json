    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The graph of $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ is a circle centered at $(0,0)$ of radius $\\sqrt{25}=5$.  Beginning at $(-5, 0)$ and working our way around the circle, we have the following 12 points on the circle:\n\n$(-5, 0)$, $(-4, 3)$, $(-3, 4)$, $(0, 5)$, $(3, 4)$, $(4, 3)$, $(5, 0)$, $(4, -3)$, $(3, -4)$, $(0, -5)$, $(-3, -4)$, $(-4, -3)$.\n\nThe greatest possible sum for any of these pairs is $3+4=\\boxed{7}$.\n\n(Of course, you could probably have guess-checked this answer relatively easily, but recognizing the equation as the graph of a circle is helpful in convincing yourself that there is no greater value of $x+y$ ... or, for example, if you wanted to find the greatest possible value of $x+y$, which is $5\\sqrt2$).",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Plotting the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 25$, we find that the solutions to this equation are the lattice points on the circle centered at the origin with radius $5$. We wish to find the pair of lattice points that lie on the line $x+y=c$ and whose sum $x+y$ is maximized. WLOG, let $x\\geq y$. We can consider the following cases:\n\nCase $1$: $y\\geq 0$. Since the line $x+y=c$ has positive slope, $x$ must be greater than zero. The possible values for $(x,y)$ in this case are $(5,0)$, $(4,3)$, $(3,4)$, and $(0,5)$, which correspond to $x+y=5$, $x+y=7$, $x+y=7$, and $x+y=5$, respectively.\n\nCase $2$: $y<0$. The possible values for $(x,y)$ in this case are $(5,0)$, $(4,-3)$, $(3,-4)$, and $(0,-5)$, which correspond to $x+y=5$, $x+y=1$, $x+y=-1$, and $x+y=-5$, respectively.\n\nThe greatest possible sum $x+y$ is $\\boxed{7}$."
