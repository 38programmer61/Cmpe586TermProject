These numbers will be the greatest integers multiplied together.\n\nSince the sum of the two integers is 246, we can write it as the equation:\n\nx + y = 246\n\nTo find the greatest product, we want the numbers to be as close to each other as possible. Therefore, we can choose the two numbers to be 123 and 123, as they have the smallest difference.\n\nThe product of 123 and 123 is:\n\n123 * 123 = 15,129\n\nSo, the greatest product obtainable from two integers whose sum is 246 is 15,129.",
