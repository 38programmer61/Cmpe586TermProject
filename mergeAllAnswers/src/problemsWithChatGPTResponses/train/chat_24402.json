                "content": "We can start at 1 and add consecutive positive integers until the sum exceeds 400. Adding consecutive positive integers is the same as using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of the first $n$ positive integers is $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. We want to find the largest $n$ such that $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\le 400$. Multiplying both sides of this inequality by 2 gives $n(n+1) \\le 800$. Trying values of $n$, we find that $n=27$ is the largest integer that satisfies this inequality, because $27(27+1)=27\\cdot 28=756<800$ and $(27+1)(28+1)=28\\cdot29=812>800$. So, the maximum number of consecutive positive integers that can be added together is $\\boxed{27}$.",
