    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the two solutions to the equation be $x_1$ and $x_2,$ where $x_1>x_2. $ It follows that  \\[x_1 - x_2 = (x_1+5)-(x_2+5) = 20 - (-20) = \\boxed{40}.\\]",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We have the two cases $x + 5 = 20$ and $x + 5 = -20.$ Solving these equations gives $x = 15$ and $x = -25,$ respectively. So the positive difference between the two solutions is $15 - (-25) = \\boxed{40}.$"
