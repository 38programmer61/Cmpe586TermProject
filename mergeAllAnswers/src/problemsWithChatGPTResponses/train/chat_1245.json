                "content": "We could solve this problem by reasoning at the start and trying different integers for $x$. However, trial and error would be much faster in this case. Since $\\log_2 16=4$ and $4^2=16$, we know that $\\log_2 16^2=4\\cdot 2=8$. Now, we look for a power of $x$ that equals 81. Since $81=3^4$, we check whether $x=3$ works. Because $\\log_3 81=4$, we have solved the equation. The answer is $\\boxed{3}.$",
