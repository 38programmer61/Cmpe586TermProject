    "problem": "A line segment of length $5$ has one endpoint at $(1, 2)$ and the other endpoint at $(4, b)$. Find all possible values of $b$, separated by commas.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{ (4-1)^2 + (b-2)^2 } = 5$. Solving, we get $3^2 + (b-2)^2 = 5^2$. $(b-2)^2 = 16$, so $b-2=4$ or $b-2=-4$. Solving, we get that $b is one of \\boxed{6, -2}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The length of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is $\\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}$.  Applying this to our segment with endpoints $(1,2)$ and $(4,b)$, we have $\\sqrt{(1-4)^2+(2-b)^2} = \\sqrt{9+(\\sqrt{b^2-4b+4})^2} = \\sqrt{9+b^2-4b+4} = \\sqrt{b^2-4b+13} = 5$.  Squaring both sides, we have $b^2-4b+13 = 25 \\Rightarrow b^2-4b-12 = 0$ which factors to $(b-6)(b+2)=0$.  Therefore the possible values of $b$ are $\\boxed{-2, 6}$."
