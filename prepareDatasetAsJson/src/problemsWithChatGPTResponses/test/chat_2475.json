The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so this sum is $(5+100)/2\\cdot20=50\\cdot20=1000$.\n\nThe sum of the first 20 positive even integers is $2+4+6+\\dots+40$. Again, the sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so this sum is $(2+40)/2\\cdot20=42\\cdot10=420$.\n\nThe positive difference between these two sums is $1000-420=\\boxed{580}$.",
