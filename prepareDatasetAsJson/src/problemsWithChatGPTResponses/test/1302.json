    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We note that $g(2)=2^2+3=7$, so $f(g(2))=f(7)=2\\cdot7-4=10.$ Therefore our answer is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "First we need to find $g(2)$ by substituting $2$ for $x$ into the expression for $g(x)$: \\begin{align*}\ng(2)&=2^2+3\\\\\n&=4+3\\\\\n&=7.\n\\end{align*}Then we need to find $f(g(2))$ by substituting $g(2)=7$ into the expression for $f(x)$: \\begin{align*}\nf(g(2))&=f(7)\\\\\n&=2(7)-4\\\\\n&=\\boxed{10}.\n\\end{align*}"
