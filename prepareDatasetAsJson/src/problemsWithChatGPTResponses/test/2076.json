    "problem": "Find the positive difference between $2(6) + 4(3)$ and $8(3+3)$.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Tweak the first expression a bit to get it in the form $4(3)+4(3)$. This is clearly twice $4(3)$, so it's $8(3)$. The difference between $8(3)$ and $8(3+3)$ is $8(3) = \\boxed{24}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Calculating each expression inside the parentheses first, we have \\begin{align*}\n2(6) + 4(3) & = 2(6) + 4(3) \\\\\n& = 12 + 12 \\\\\n& = 24,\n\\end{align*}and \\begin{align*}\n8(3+3) & = 8(6) \\\\\n& = 48.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $2(6) + 4(3) - 8(3+3) = 24 - 48 = \\boxed{-24}$."
