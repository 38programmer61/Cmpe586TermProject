                "content": "Setting $x=2$ and $x=4$ in the equation, we find $y=2^2+2b+c$ and $y=4^2+4b+c$. Both equations simplify to $y=4+2b+c$.\n\nSince we know that the parabola passes through $(2,3)$ and $(4,3)$, we can substitute these coordinates into the equation $y=4+2b+c$:\n\nSetting $x=2$, we have $y=4+2b+c=3$. Setting $x=4$, we have $y=4+2b+c=3$.\n\nSince both equations must be equal to $3$, we have the equations $4+2b+c=3$ and $4+2b+c=3$. Subtracting $4+2b+c=3$ from $4+2b+c=3$, we get $0=0$.\n\nSince the equation $0=0$ is always true, this means that the equation $4+2b+c=3$ is a true statement.  In particular, we can substitute $c$ by $-1-2b$ in this equation to obtain $4b-1=3$.\n\nSolving this equation gives $b=2$. Substituting $b=2$ in the equation $4+2b+c=3$ we find $8+c=3$, so that $c=\\boxed{-5}$.",
