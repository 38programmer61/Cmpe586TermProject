    "problem": "Suppose $K$ is a constant, such that no pair of real numbers $(x,y)$ satisfies this system of equations: $$6x + 4y = 7$$ $$Kx + 8y = 7$$\n\nWhat is the value of $K$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "A system of linear equations won't have a solution if the two equations in the system contradict each other.  Multiplying the first equation by 2, we get the equations\n\\begin{align*}\n12x + 8y &= 14, \\\\\nKx + 8y &= 7.\n\\end{align*}If $K = 12,$ then the two equations contradict each other.  Otherwise, we can subtract them to get $(K - 12) x = -7.$  We can solve this equation to find $x,$ then substitute to find $y.$\n\nSo the value of $K$ for which the system has no solution is $K = \\boxed{12}.$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "For simplicity, we begin by multiplying the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $3$ to cancel out the coefficients of $y$: \\begin{align*}\n12x+8y&=14, \\\\\n3Kx+24y&=21.\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we have $$\\begin{aligned} (3K-12)x+(24-8)y&=21-14 \\\\ 0 \\cdot x+16y &=7. \\end{aligned}$$ Since $0x = 0$ for any real number $x,$ this reduces to $16y = 7.$ Dividing both sides of the equation by $16$ gives us $y= \\frac78.$\n\nSubstituting $y=\\frac78$ into $6x+4y=7$, we have \\begin{align*}\n6x+4\\left(\\frac78\\right)&=7 \\\\\n6x+\\frac{16}{8}&=7 \\\\\n6x+2&=7 \\\\\n6x&=5\\\\\nx&=\\frac{5}{6}.\n\\end{align*} Thus, a valid solution $(x,y)$ exists. Since we assumed otherwise, our assumption must be false. Thus, the system has at least one solution for any value of $K.$ Therefore, $K = \\boxed{\\text{anything}}$ is a valid solution."
