    "problem": "If $x + y = 7$ and $x - y = 9$, find the product of $x$ and $y$.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "It seems easiest to first solve for $x$ and then for $y$. We can solve for $x$ by adding the two equations together, giving $2x = 16$, or $x = 8$. Plugging $x$ into the first equation gives $8 + y = 7$, so $y = -1$. So, $x\\cdot y = \\boxed{-8}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Squaring both equations, we have $(x+y)^2 = 7^2 = 49$ and $(x-y)^2 = 9^2 = 81$.  Expanding and subtracting these equations results in $4xy = 81-49 = 32$.  Thus, $xy = \\boxed{8}$."
