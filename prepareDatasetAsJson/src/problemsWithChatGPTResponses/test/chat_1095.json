                "content": "We know that revenue is equal to price multiplied by quantity sold. In this case, price is $p$ dollars and quantity sold is $128-4p$. Therefore, revenue is equal to $p \\cdot (128-4p)$. Expanding this expression, we find that revenue is equal to $128p-4p^2$. We want to maximize this revenue expression. To do so, we note that $-4p^2$ is a quadratic with a negative leading coefficient, so the graph of this expression opens downwards. Therefore, the maximum value of this expression occurs at the vertex, which is at $p=\\frac{-b}{2a}=\\frac{-128}{2(-4)}=16$. Since $p \\le 32$, the price should be $\\boxed{16}$ dollars.",
