                "content": "For simplicity, scale the triangle so that the sum of the x-coordinates of its vertices is 3. Let the vertices of the triangle be $(a,0),(b,c),(3-a,0),$ with $a,b<1.$ The coordinates of midpoint of a side of the triangle with one vertex $(a,0)$ and another $(b,c)$ is $(\\frac{a+b}{2},\\frac{c}{2}).$ Note that the x-coordinate of the midpoint of any side is strictly between zero and one. Thus $S,S'$ (the sum of the y-coordinates) is a point strictly inside a triangle with vertices $(0,0),(1,0),(0,c),$ hence $(x,y)$ satisfies $x+yS'=\\frac{b+c}{4}<\\frac{3}{4}.$ Therefore $S'<\\frac{3}{4}$ and thus $S<\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2+1^2}<\\sqrt{2}.$ As $S$ is the x-coordinate of a point on the circle with diameter $SM,$ it follows that $S^2<2,$ so the answer is $\\boxed{001}.$",
