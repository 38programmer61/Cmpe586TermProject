                "content": "Let the two consecutive positive even numbers be $x$ and $x+2$.  Squaring these, we have $(x)^2$ and $(x+2)^2$. Setting up the equation $(x+2)^2 - (x)^2 = 60$, we have $$x^2 + 4x + 4 - x^2 = 60.$$ Simplifying gives $4x+4=60$.  Subtracting 4 from both sides, we have $4x = 56$, and dividing by 4 gives $x=14$. So the original two numbers are 14 and 16, and their sum is $14+16 = \\boxed{30}$.",
