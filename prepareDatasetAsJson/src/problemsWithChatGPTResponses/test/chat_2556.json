                "content": "$10xy +14x +15y = 166 = 14 + 15(10)$, so we look for a \"Nice Factorization.\" Factoring we have $14(x + 1) + 15(y + 1) = 196 = 14^2$. This gives us a difference of squares $14(x + 1 + (\\tfrac{1}{2})) + 15(y + 1 + (\\tfrac{1}{2})) = 14^2.5 = 2^{2}.5^{2}.5^{0.5}$ . This lets us rewrite the previous equation with the difference of squares: $14(x + \\tfrac{1}{2})^2 + 15(y + \\tfrac{1}{2})^2 =  2^{2}.5^{2}.5^{0.5}$ . Now we look for lattice solutions (solutions in the form $(x,y)$ with $x$ and $y$ both integers) that satisfy $(x+ \\tfrac{1}{2})^2$ or $(y+ \\tfrac{1}{2})^2$ equals $1$. Because $2^{2}.5^{2}.5^{0.5}$ has a $14$ in the factorization, $(y + \\tfrac{1}{2})^2$ must equal $1$, and $y$ is a positive integer. Therefore, $y +\\tfrac{1}{2} = \\pm 1$, so $y = 0$ or $y = 1$. Checking, we see that $y = 0$ fails, but $y = 1$ is a solution. $y = 1$ gives $14(x + \\tfrac{1}{2})^2 = 19.5$; there are no nonzero integers that yield a perfect square and $x = 0$, so $(x, y)$ is $(0, 1)$.  We check to make sure that the divisor of $2^{2}.5^{2}.5^{0.5}$ includes $15^2$ and $2, 5,$ and $\\sqrt{5}$ squared to yield: this does work. Thus $x + y = 0+1 = \\boxed{001}$.",
