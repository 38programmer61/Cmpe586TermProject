    "problem": "Jeremiah is riding in a car that is traveling 60 miles per hour. At this rate, how many minutes will it take him to travel 20 miles?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Distance equals rate times time, so the trip will take $$\\frac{20\\text{ mi.}}{60\\text{ mph}}=\\frac{1}{3}\\text{ hours}.$$  One-third of an hour is $\\boxed{20}$ minutes.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "To find the time it takes for Jeremiah to travel 20 miles, we need to divide the distance by the speed. \n\n60 miles per hour is equivalent to 1 mile per minute.\nSo it will take Jeremiah 20 minutes to travel 20 miles."
