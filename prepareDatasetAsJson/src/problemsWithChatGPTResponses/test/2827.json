    "problem": "The first term of an arithmetic sequence is $2$. The sum of the third and the sixth terms is $25$. What is the fourth term?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the difference between two consecutive terms $x$. The third term is then $2+2x$, and the sixth term is $2+5x$. So, $25 = (2+2x) + (2+5x)$. Solving for $x$ gives $7x = 21$, or $x = 3$. So, the fourth term is $2 + 3\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{11}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let $d$ be the common difference.  Then the third term is $2 + 2d$, and the sixth term is $2 + 5d$, so $2 + 2d + 2 + 5d = 25$.  Simplifying the left side gives $7d + 4 = 25$, so $7d = 21$ and $d = 3$.  The fourth term is $2 + 3d = \\boxed{11}$."
