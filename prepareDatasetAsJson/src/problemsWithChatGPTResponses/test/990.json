    "problem": "When Frederick was born, his grandparents gave him a gift of $\\$2000$, which was invested at a simple interest rate of $5\\%$ per year.  How much money will Frederick have when he can collect the money at the age of $18$?  (Assume no money is added to the account besides the interest.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If the interest is simple, then Frederick's money grows by $\\allowbreak .05(2000)=100$ dollars per year.  This means he gained $18\\times100=\\$1800$, so he has a total of $2000+1800=\\boxed{\\$3800}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "At the end of each year, the balance of the account is multiplied by $1 + \\frac{0.05}{1} = 1.05$.  After the money is compounded $18$ times, the amount of money Frederick has is $2000 \\cdot 1.05^{18} \\approx \\boxed{\\$5632.69}$."
