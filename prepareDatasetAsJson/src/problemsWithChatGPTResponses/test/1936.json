    "problem": "Let $f(x) = x - 3$ and $q(x) = bx +1$.  If $f(q(1)) = -3$, what is $b$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have $q(1) = b\\cdot 1 + 1 = b+1$, so $f(q(1)) = f(b+1)$. Applying the definition of $f$, we have $f(q(1)) = f(b+1) = (b+1) - 3 = b-2$.  Therefore, the equation $f(q(1)) = -3$ gives us $b-2 = -3$, so $ b= \\boxed{-1}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since we know that $f(x) = x-3$, we have $f(q(1)) = q(1) - 3$. Setting this equal to $-3$, we have $q(1) - 3 = -3$. Therefore, we have $q(1) = 0$. \n\nSince we know that $q(x) = bx+1$, we have $q(1) = b(1) + 1$. Setting this equal to $0$, we have $b(1) + 1 = 0$. Therefore, we have $b+1=0$, which implies $b=\\boxed{-1}$."
