    "problem": "Wendy has 180 feet of fencing. She needs to enclose a rectangular space with an area that is ten times its perimeter. If she uses up all her fencing material, how many feet is the largest side of the enclosure?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let's call the length of the rectangle $l$, and the width $w$. In general, the perimeter of a rectangle can be expressed as the sum of all four sides. Thus, it is equal to $2l+2w$. Similarly, we can express the area of the rectangle as $lw$. Since we know that Wendy uses all the fencing, the perimeter of the rectangle she encloses must be 180 feet. The area, which is 10 times that, comes out to 1800 feet. This gives us a system of two equations:  \\begin{align*} 2l+2w& =180\n\\\\lw& =1800. \\end{align*}If we solve for $l$ in terms of $w$ using the first equation, we find that $180-2w=2l$, or $l=90-w$. We can plug this expression back into the the second equation, giving us  \\begin{align*} (90-w)(w)& =1800\n\\\\ 90w-w^2& =1800\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad w^2-90w+1800& =0\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad (w-60)(w-30)& =0 \\end{align*}Thus, the two possible values of $w$ are 60 feet and 30 feet. Since $l=90-w$, the possible values of $l$ must be 30 feet or 60 feet (respectively). Since the problem asks for the largest side, the answer is ultimately $\\boxed{60}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the length of the rectangle be L and the width be W.\nThe perimeter is equal to 2L + 2W.\nThe area is equal to L * W.\nAccording to the problem, the area is ten times the perimeter, so:\nL * W = 10(2L + 2W).\nExpanding the right side of the equation, we get:\nL * W = 20L + 20W\nSubtracting 20L from both sides, we get:\nL * W - 20L = 20W\nFactoring out an L from the left side, we get:\nL(W - 20) = 20W\nDividing both sides by (W - 20), we get:\nL = 20W / (W - 20)\nAccording to the problem, Wendy has 180 feet of fencing, so the perimeter is 180 feet.\nSubstituting 180 for the perimeter in the equation, we get:\n180 = 2L + 2W\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n90 = L + W\nRearranging this equation, we get:\nL = 90 - W.\nSubstituting this equation for L in the earlier equation, we get:\n90 - W = 20W / (W - 20)\nMultiplying both sides by (W - 20), we get:\n90(W - 20) - W(W - 20) = 20W\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n90W - 1800 - W^2 + 20W = 20W\nCombining like terms, we get:\n90W - 1800 - W^2 + 20W - 20W = 0\nCombining like terms again, we get:\n-W^2 + 90W - 1800 = 0\nDividing all terms by -1, we get:\nW^2 - 90W + 1800 = 0\nFactoring the left side, we get:\n(W - 60)(W - 30) = 0\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we get:\nW - 60 = 0 or W - 30 = 0\nSolving each equation, we find that W = 60 or W = 30.\nIf W = 60, then L = 90 - 60 = 30.\nIf W = 30, then L = 90 - 30 = 60.\nSince we want to find the largest side of the rectangle, the answer is 60 feet. Answer: \\boxed{60}."
