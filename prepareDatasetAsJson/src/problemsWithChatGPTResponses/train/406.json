    "problem": "The difference between two positive integers is 6 and their product is 112. What is the sum of the integers?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the integers be $x$ and $y$, with $x>y$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\nx-y&=6\\\\\nxy&=112\n\\end{align*}Squaring the first equation, we get  \\[(x-y)^2=6^2\\Rightarrow x^2-2xy+y^2=36\\]Multiplying the second equation by four, we get $4xy = 4\\cdot112=448$. Adding these last two equations, we have \\[x^2-2xy+y^2+4xy=36+448 \\Rightarrow (x+y)^2=484 \\Rightarrow x+y = 22\\]In the last step, we take the positive square root because both $x$ and $y$ are given to be positive. The sum of the two integers is $\\boxed{22}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the two positive integers be $x$ and $y$, where $x > y$. We have the system of equations \\[\\begin{aligned} x - y &= 6, \\\\ xy &= 112. \\end{aligned}\\] From the first equation, $x = y + 6$. Substituting into the second equation, we get \\[(y + 6)(y) = 112.\\] Expanding, we get $y^2 + 6y - 112 = 0$. We recognize this as a quadratic equation that factors as \\[(y - 4)(y + 28) = 0.\\] Thus, $y - 4 = 0$ or $y + 28 = 0$. If $y - 4 = 0$, then $y = 4$, so $x = 4 + 6 = 10$. If $y + 28 = 0$, then $y = -28$, which is not a positive integer. Therefore, the integers are 4 and 10, and their sum is $\\boxed{14}$."
