                "content": "Let $n$ be the number of times Pirate Pete has spoken. We know that Paul has $1 + 2 + \\dots + n=\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$ coins, and Pete has $x + 2x+ \\dots + nx= n(n + 1)x/2$ coins.\n\nWe set up the equation $\\frac{n(n + 1)x}{2} = 4 \\cdot \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\Rightarrow x = 4.$  Substituting this value into $n(n + 1)x/2$, we find that the sum of all the coins is $n(n + 1)(n + 1) = n^3 + 2n^2 + n$.\n\nThe equation $n^3 + 2n^2 + n = (n)(n + 1)(n + 1)$ has solutions $n = 0$ and $n = -1.$  However, since $n$ is the number of times Pirate Pete has spoken, which must be nonnegative, the only possible value for $n$ is 0.\n\nThus, the sum of all the coins is $0^3 + 2(0)^2 + 0 = \\boxed{0}.$",
