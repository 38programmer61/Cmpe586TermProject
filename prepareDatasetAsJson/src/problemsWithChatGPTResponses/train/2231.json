    "problem": "The expression $\\frac{x-3}{4x}$ is equal to zero for what value of $x$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The fraction is equal to zero if the numerator is equal to zero. Thus, $x-3=0$, so $x=\\boxed{3}$. (Note that at this $x$ value, the denominator is not equal to zero.)",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We have $\\frac{x-3}{4x} = 0$. Since a fraction is equal to zero only when the numerator is equal to zero, we have $x-3 = 0$. Therefore, the value of $x$ that makes the expression equal to zero is $x = \\boxed{3}$."
