    "chatgpt_solution": "We're given that $a*b=a^2+ab-b^2$ for all numbers $a$ and $b$. We want to find $3*2$. Replacing $a$ with 3 and $b$ with 2 in the given expression, we have  $$3*2=3^2+3\\cdot2-2^2.$$Calculating the right-hand side, we find $$3*2=9+6-4.$$Further calculating the right-hand side, we find $$3*2=9+6-4 = \\boxed{11}.$$"
