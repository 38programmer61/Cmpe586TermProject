    "problem": "Two positive integers differ by 6 and their product is 135. What is the larger integer?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "135 factors into four possible pairs: $(1,135)$, $(3,45)$, $(5,27)$, and $(9,15)$. The only one of these with difference 6 is $(9,15)$, which has a larger integer of $\\boxed{15}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the two positive integers be $x$ and $y$, where $x>y$. We are given that $x-y=6$ and $xy=135$. From the first equation, we get $x=y+6$, which we can subtitute into the second equation to get $(y+6)y=135$. Expanding the left side gives $y^2+6y=135$. Rearranging this equation gives $y^2+6y-135=0$. We can factor this quadratic equation as $(y-9)(y+15)=0$. The two possible values for $y$ are $9$ and $-15$. Since $y$ is positive, the only possible value for $y$ is $9$. Plugging this value into $x=y+6$ gives $x=9+6=15$. The larger integer is $\\boxed{15}$."
