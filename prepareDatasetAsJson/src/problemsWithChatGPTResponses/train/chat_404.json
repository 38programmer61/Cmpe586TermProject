                "content": "Since the seventh term equals $7$ and we know that the common ratio between terms is the same, we see that the tenth term is equal to $\\frac{21}{7}=\\boxed{3}$. The ratio is then $3/7$. We can check that this is common ratio by further multiplying by $3/7$ to yield 1, the base term of the geometric sequence. Thus the twelfth term is $3\\cdot \\frac{3}{7}=\\frac{9}{7}$ and the thirteenth term is $\\frac{9}{7}\\cdot\\frac{3}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{27}{49}}$.",
