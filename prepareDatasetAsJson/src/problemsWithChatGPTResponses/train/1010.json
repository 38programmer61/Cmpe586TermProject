    "solution": "Since $18 - 14 = 4$, the common difference in the first column of squares is 4, so the number above 14 is $14 - 4 = 10$, and the number above 10 is $10 - 4 = 6$.  This is also the fourth number in the row, so the common difference in the row is $(6 - 21)/3 = -5$.\n\nThen the seventh (and last) number in the row is $21 - 5 \\cdot 6 = -9$.  In the second column, the common difference is $[(-17) - (-9)]/4 = -2$, so $N = -9 - (-2) = \\boxed{-7}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let $x$ be the difference between consecutive terms in the arithmetic sequence in the row of squares, $y$ be the difference between consecutive terms in the arithmetic sequence in the first column of squares, and $z$ be the difference between consecutive terms in the arithmetic sequence in the second column of squares. From the diagram, we can construct three equations:  \\begin{align*}\n21+5x&=N \\\\\n14+2y&=N \\\\\n18+3z&=N\n\\end{align*} We can solve for $N$ by setting the three expressions equal to each other: \\begin{align*}\n21+5x&=14+2y \\\\\n14+2y&=18+3z \\\\\n21+5x&=18+3z\n\\end{align*} Solving the first two equations yields $\\begin{array}{l l}y=3x,&(1) \\\\ z=4y,&(2)\\end{array}$ but substitution gives $z=4(3x)=12x$. The third equation yields $21+5x=18+3(12x)$. Simplifying yields $-33x=-9$, so $x=\\frac{3}{11}$. Since $y=3x$, $y=\\frac{3}{11}\\cdot3=\\frac{9}{11}$. Substituting into the first equation gives $21+5\\left(\\frac{3}{11}\\right)=N+\\frac{9}{11}$, so $N=21+\\frac{15}{11}-\\frac{9}{11}=\\frac{216}{11}$. Thus, $N=\\boxed{216}$."
