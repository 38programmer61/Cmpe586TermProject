                "content": "We look for a pair of monic linear polynomials, $(x + a) (x + b)$, which multiply to make $3x^2 + nx + 72$. The product is $$3x^2 + nx + 72 = x^2 (3) + x(an+b) + ab$$So we must have $3|ab$. There are three cases to consider here: $a$ is zero, $b$ is zero, or neither is zero.\n\nIf $a = 0$, then $x^2 + bx + 72 = (x + 8)(x+9)$, which has roots $-8,-9$. In this case, $b=-8-9 = -17$ and $n = ab = 0 \\cdot -17 = \\boxed{0}$.\n\nIf $b = 0$, then $x^2 + ax + 72 = (x + 6)(x+12)$, which has roots $-6, -12$. In this case, $a = -6 - 12 = -18$ and $n = ab = 0 \\cdot -18 = \\boxed{0}$.\n\nIf neither $a$ nor $b$ is zero, then $a$ and $b$ are both integers which are multiples of 3. Since $(a + b)x$ is the coefficient of $x$ in $ax + bx$, we must have $a+b = n$. The largest such $n$ will occur when $a = -1$, $b = -3$, giving $n = \\boxed{2}$.\n\nTogether, the largest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
