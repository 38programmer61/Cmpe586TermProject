                "content": "We can find the points of intersection one by one. To find the intersection of lines $1$ and $2$, $3y - 2x = 1$ and $x + 2y = 2$, we could substitute $x + 2y = 2$ into the first equation. Substituting, we find that\n\\[3y - 2x = 1\\]ands\n\\[3y - 4 + 2y = 1.\\]We can check that this is a valid point of intersection. Similarly, we can find the points of intersection between lines $1$ and $3$ and between lines $2$ and $3$ by substituting one equation into another. Then we check that the intersection is valid. Thus, there is a point of intersection between the pair of lines $1$ and $2,$ between the pair of lines $1$ and $3,$ and between the pair of lines $2$ and $3.$\n\nAre any of these three points of intersection shared? No, none of them are. Thus, there are $\\boxed{3}$ points in total that lie at the intersection of at least two of the three lines.",
