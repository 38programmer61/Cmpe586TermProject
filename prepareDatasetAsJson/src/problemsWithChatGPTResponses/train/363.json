    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Cross-multiplication gives  \\[3x^2+2x+1=(x-1)(3x+1)=3x^2-2x-1.\\]Therefore \\[4x=-2\\]and $x=\\boxed{-\\frac{1}2}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Cross-multiplication gives \\[3x^2 + 2x + 1 = (x - 1)(3x+1) = 3x^2 - 2x -1.\\]Rearranging gives $0 = 2x^2 - 4x - 2 = x^2 -2x -1$. To factor this quadratic, we look for two numbers that multiply to be $-1$ and add to be $-2$. The numbers $-1$ and $1$ work, so the quadratic factors as $(x-1)^2 = 0$. The solutions are $x = \\boxed{1}$."
