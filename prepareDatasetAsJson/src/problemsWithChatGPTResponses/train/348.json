    "problem": "The roots of the equation $2x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0$ can be written in the form $x = \\frac{m \\pm \\sqrt{n}}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers with a greatest common divisor of 1. What is the value of $n$?",

    "solution": "This problem is an application of the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Using the quadratic formula, we find that $x = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 +32}}{4} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{57}}{4}$. Since $4$ and $57$ are relatively prime, $n = \\boxed{57}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We use the quadratic formula to find that \\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{5^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (-4)} }{2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{41} }{2}.\n\\end{align*} Thus, $n = \\boxed{41}.$"
