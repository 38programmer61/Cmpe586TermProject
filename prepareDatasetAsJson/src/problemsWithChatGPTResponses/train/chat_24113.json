                "content": "Let the common ratio be $r$. Then the second term is the first term times the common ratio, so $2 = a \\cdot r$. Similarly, the fourth term is the second term times the common ratio, so $6 = 2 \\cdot r^2$. \n\nDividing these two equations, we get $\\frac{6}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot r^2}{a \\cdot r}$. Simplifying gives $3 = \\frac{r}{a}$.\n\nSince $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio, the only way that $\\frac{r}{a}$ can be equal to $3$ is if $r = 3a$. \n\nSubstituting this into the second equation gives $6 = 2 \\cdot (3a)^2 = 2 \\cdot 9a^2 = 18a^2$. Dividing by $18$, we have $a^2 = \\frac{6}{18} = \\frac{1}{3}$, so $a = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\n\nSince the problem asks for a possible first term, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.",
