    "problem": "The ratio of the areas of two squares is $\\frac{32}{63}$. After rationalizing the denominator, the ratio of their side lengths can be expressed in the simplified form $\\frac{a\\sqrt{b}}{c}$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers. What is the value of the sum $a+b+c$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The area of a square equals the side length squared, so we can get the ratio of side lengths by taking the square root of the ratio of areas: $$\\sqrt{\\frac{32}{63}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{32}}{\\sqrt{63}}=\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3\\sqrt{7}}=\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3\\sqrt{7}}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{\\sqrt{7}}=\\frac{4\\sqrt{14}}{21}.$$So, our answer is $4+14+21=\\boxed{39}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the side lengths of the squares be $s_1$ and $s_2$, respectively. We are given that\n\\[\\frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2} = \\frac{32}{63}.\\]Simplifying, we have\n\\[\\frac{s_1}{s_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{32}{63}} = \\frac{4 \\sqrt{2}}{3 \\sqrt{7}}.\\]This ratio of side lengths can be simplified as $\\frac{4 \\sqrt{14}}{9},$ so $a + b + c = 4 + 14+ 9 = \\boxed{27}.$"
