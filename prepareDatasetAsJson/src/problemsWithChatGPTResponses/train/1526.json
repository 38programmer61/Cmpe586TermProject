    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $9$ can be written as $3^2$, we know that $3^{x^2+4x+4}=3^{2(x+2)}$ and $x^2+4x+4=2(x+2)$. Solving for $x$ we have: \\begin{align*}\nx^2+4x+4=2x+4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x^2+2x=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x(x+2)=0\\\\\n\\end{align*}So, $x=-2$ or $x=0$. Checking these solutions, we find that $3^0=9^0$ and $3^4=9^2$, which are both true statements. The sum of all possible values of $x$ is $-2+0=\\boxed{-2}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Writing both sides with a base of $3$ and expanding the exponents using the laws of exponents give $3^{x^2+4x+4}=(3^2)^{x+2}\\Longrightarrow3^{x^2+4x+4}=3^{2x+4}.$\nSince the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal, so $x^2+4x+4=2x+4.$ Moving all the terms to the left-hand side gives $x^2+2x=0,$ and factoring gives $x(x+2)=0.$ The solutions are $x=0$ or $x=-2.$\n\nAlternatively, instead of factoring, we could have applied the zero-product property, which states that if $ab = 0$ then either $a = 0$ or $b = 0.$"
