    "problem": "The sum of two numbers is $12$ and their difference is $20$. What is the smaller number?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the larger number and $y$ be the smaller number. Then we have $x+y=12$ and $x-y=20$. If we subtract the second equation from the first, we get $$x+y-(x-y)=12-20\\qquad\\Rightarrow 2y=-8\\qquad\\Rightarrow y=-4.$$ The smaller number is $\\boxed{-4}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\nx+y&=12 \\\\\nx-y&=20.\n\\end{align*}Adding the equations gives $(x+y)+(x-y)=12+20$, so $2x=32$ and $x=\\boxed{16}$."
