    "problem": "How much money should I invest at an annually compounded interest rate of $5\\%$  so that I have $\\$500,\\!000$ in ten years?  Express your answer as a dollar value rounded to the nearest cent.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "This question is equivalent to asking, \"What is the present value of $\\$500,\\!000$ paid 10 years from now if the annually compounded interest rate is $5\\%$?\"  This present value is \\[\\frac{\\$500,\\!000}{(1+0.05)^{10}} \\approx \\boxed{\\$306,\\!956.63}.\\]",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the initial investment be $x$.  Then in ten years, the investment will grow to $x \\cdot 1.05^{10}$, so we want \\[x \\cdot 1.05^{10} = \\$500,\\!000.\\]Dividing both sides by $1.05^{10}$, we find $x = \\frac{\\$500,\\!000}{1.05^{10}} \\approx \\boxed{\\$304,\\!336.85}.$"
