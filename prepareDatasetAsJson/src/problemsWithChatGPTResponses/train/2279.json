    "problem": "What is the slope of a line parallel to the line $2x - 4y = 9$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The slope-intercept form of the equation of a line is $y = m x + b$ where $m$ is the slope.  So if we get $y$ on the opposite side from $x$ and make it have a coefficient of 1, the slope of the line will be the coefficient of $x$.  Thus we add $4y$ to both sides and divide everything by 4 which makes the coefficient of $x$ equal to $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "To find the slope of a line, we can put the equation of the line into slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line.\n\nRearranging the given equation $2x - 4y = 9$ to slope-intercept form, we subtract $2x$ from both sides of the equation and divide by $-4$ to get \\[y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{9}{4}.\\]Thus, a line with an equation of the form $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + b$ will be parallel to $2x - 4y = 9$. Therefore, the slope of a line parallel to $2x - 4y = 9$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$."
