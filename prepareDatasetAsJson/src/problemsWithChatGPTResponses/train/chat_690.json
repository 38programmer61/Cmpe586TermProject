                "content": "Let $\\lfloor r \\rfloor = n$ and $r = a$, where $n$ is an integer and $a$ is a real number such that $0 \\leq a < 1$. The given equation of $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r = 16.5$ can be rewritten as $n + a = 16.5$. Since $0 \\leq a < 1$, we know that $16 \\leq n + a < 17$. Hence, $16 \\leq 16.5 = n + a < 17.$ It follows that $16 \\leq n + 0 \\leq n + a < n + 1 \\leq 17 < n + 1 + 0 \\leq n + 1 + a < n + 1 + 1$ since $0 \\leq a < 1$. Hence, $16 \\leq n \\leq 17$. There are two possible integer values for $n$: 16 or 17. When $n = 16$, we substitute $n$ back into $n + a = 16.5$ and find that $16 + a = 16.5$, so $a = 0.5$. When $n = 17$, we substitute $n$ back into $n + a = 16.5$ and find that $17 + a = 16.5$, which has no solutions for $a$. Therefore, the only solution is $n = \\boxed{16}$.",
