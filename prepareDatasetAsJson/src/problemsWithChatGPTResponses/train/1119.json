    "solution": "When $x=-1$, we have $y = a-b+c$.  The graph appears to pass through $(-1,-2)$.  Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers, we know that $y$ is an integer when $x=-1$, so the graph does indeed pass through $(-1,-2)$.  Therefore, $y=-2$ when $x=-1$, so $a-b+c = \\boxed{-2}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "From the graph, we observe that the vertex of the parabola is at the point $(-1,-2)$. Since the equation of a parabola in vertex form is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex, we can write the equation of the parabola as $y=a(x+1)^2-2$. Expanding $(x+1)^2$ gives $y=a(x^2+2x+1)-2$. Distributing the $a$ gives $y=ax^2+2ax+a-2$. Comparing this with the equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$, we see that $b=2a$ and $a-2=c$. From $b=2a$, we find that $a=\\frac{b}{2}$. Substituting this into the equation $a-2=c$, we find that $\\frac{b}{2}-2=c$, or $\\frac{b-4}{2}=c$. Thus, $a-b+c=\\frac{b}{2}-b+\\frac{b-4}{2}=-\\frac{b}{2}-2=-\\frac{b+4}{2}=-b-2$. Since $b$ is an integer, the value of $a-b+c$ is always an integer, so our answer is $\\boxed{-2}$."
