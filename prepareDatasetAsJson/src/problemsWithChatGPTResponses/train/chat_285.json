                "content": "To find the sum of all integers from 80 through 90, inclusive, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nS = (n/2)(a + l),\n\nwhere S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.\n\nThe first term is 80 and the last term is 90. The number of terms can be calculated using the formula:\n\nn = l - a + 1,\n\nwhere n is the number of terms, l is the last term, and a is the first term.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nn = 90 - 80 + 1\n  = 11.\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum:\n\nS = (n/2)(a + l)\n  = (11/2)(80 + 90)\n  = 5.5(170)\n  = 935.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integers from 80 through 90, inclusive, is 935.",
