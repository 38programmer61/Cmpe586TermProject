    "problem": "What is the distance, in units, between the points $(-3, -4)$ and $(4, -5)$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We use the distance formula:  \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(4 - (-3))^2 + ((-5) - (-4))^2} &= \\sqrt{7^2 + (-1)^2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{49 + 1} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{50} \\\\\n&= \\boxed{5\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Using the distance formula, the distance between the two points is equal to $\\sqrt{(-3-4)^{2}+(-4-(-5))^{2}}=\\sqrt{49+1}=\\sqrt{50}=\\boxed{5\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nNote: Both $\\sqrt{50}$ and $5\\sqrt{2}$ are in simplest radical form."
