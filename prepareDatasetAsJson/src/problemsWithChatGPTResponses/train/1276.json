    "problem": "The side length of square $A$ is 36 cm. The side length of square $B$ is 42 cm. What is the ratio of the area of square $A$ to the area of square $B$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The ratio of their areas is going to be the ratio of their side lengths, but squared. The ratio of the side length of square A to that of B is $\\frac{36}{42}=\\frac{6}{7}$. Thus, the ratio of their areas is $\\left( \\frac{6}{7} \\right) ^2=\\boxed{\\frac{36}{49}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since the side length of square $A$ is $36$ cm and the side length of square $B$ is $42$ cm, the ratio of their areas is $\\frac{\\left(36 \\text{ cm}\\right)^2}{\\left(42 \\text{ cm}\\right)^2}=\\frac{4^2 \\cdot 3^2}{6^2 \\cdot 7^2}=\\frac{2^2}{3^2 \\cdot 7^2}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{441}}$."
