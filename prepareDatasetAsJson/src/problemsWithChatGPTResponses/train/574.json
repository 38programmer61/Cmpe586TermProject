    "problem": "Find the product of the roots of the equation $18t^2 + 45t -500 =0$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The product of the roots equals the constant term divided by the coefficient of the quadratic term, or $(-500)/18 = \\boxed{-\\frac{250}{9}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We can also find the roots by factoring out a $3$ from every term, giving $3(6t^2+15t-1667)=0$, so \\[\n6t^2+15t-1667 =0.\n\\]We do not have to factor this any further because there is no common factor among the coefficients and we cannot simplify the quadratic with rational coefficients any more than we already have.\n\nWe can check that the discriminant of this quadratic is $15^2-4(6)(-1667)=225+40008 = 40233$. This expression does not factor, so its square root cannot be simplified.\n\nWe apply the quadratic formula and write $t$ in terms of $\\pm\\sqrt{40233}$: \\[\nt=\\frac{-15\\pm\\sqrt{40233}}{12}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad t=\\frac{-15\\pm \\sqrt{40233}}{12}.\n\\]Therefore the product of the roots is \\begin{align*}\n\\left(\\frac{-15+ \\sqrt{40233}}{12}\\right)\\left(\\frac{-15- \\sqrt{40233}}{12}\\right)&=\\frac{(-15+\\sqrt{40233})(-15-\\sqrt{40233})}{(12)(12)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{(169-40233)}{(12)(12)} \\\\\n&=\\frac{-40064}{144} = \\boxed{-278}.\n\\end{align*}"
