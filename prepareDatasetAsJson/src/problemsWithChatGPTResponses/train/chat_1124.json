                "content": "Let the common ratio of the geometric sequence be $r$. We know that the first term is 3, so the second term is $3r$, the third term is $(3r)r = 3r^2$, and the fourth term is $(3r^2)r = 3r^3 = 192$. Dividing both sides of the equation $3r^3 = 192$ by 3, we get $r^3=64$. Since $4^3 = 64$, the common ratio $r=4$. Therefore, the third term of the sequence is $(3)(4^2) = \\boxed{48}$.",
