                "content": "We can start by factoring $(n+3)(n-7) = n^2-4n-21 = (n-7)(n+3)$. Then we see that one of the factors must be non-positive and the other non-negative. This can only occur when $n$ is between $-3$ and $7$. Thus, we must count the integers in this interval, inclusive. Since $-3,6,7$ are integers in this range, there are $\\boxed{10}$ integers $n$. (Note: This problem can also be solved by a sign table, but that would be slower).",
