Thus, we have \\begin{align*}\n(t-6)(2t-5)&=(2t-8)(t-5)\\\\\nt(2t-5)-(6)(2t-5)&=2t(t-4)-(8)(t-4)\\\\\n2t^2-5t-12t+30&=2t^2-8t-4t+32\\\\\n2t^2-17t+30&=2t^2-12t+32\\\\\n-17t+30&=-12t+32\\\\\n-17t+12t&=32-30\\\\\n-5t&=2.\n\\end{align*} Dividing $-5t=2$ by $-5$ will give us the solution $t=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{5}}.$",
