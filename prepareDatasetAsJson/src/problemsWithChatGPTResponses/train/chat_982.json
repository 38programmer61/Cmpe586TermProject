                "content": "For $x^2 + 6x + 9$ to be between 20 and 40, we need to have $20 < x^2 + 6x + 9 < 40$. Subtracting 20 from all three parts of this inequality gives  \\[\n0 < x^2 + 6x - 11 < 20.\n\\]Completing the square on $x^2+6x-11$ gives\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+6x-11 &= (x^2 + 6x + 9) - 20 \\\\\n&= (x+3)^2 - 20.\n\\end{align*}So we need $(x+3)^2 - 20 < 20$.  Add 20 to all three parts of this inequality to get  \\[\n(x+3)^2 < 40\n\\]Multiplying each part by $-1$ gives $-(x+3)^2 > -40$.  Dividing each part by $-1$ reverses the inequalities: $$-40 < -(x+3)^2 < 40.$$Taking the square roots of each part gives $\\sqrt{-40} < -(x+3) < \\sqrt{40}$.  Since $x$ is a positive integer, $-(x+3)$ is negative, hence $x+3$ must be between $\\sqrt{40}$ and $-\\sqrt{40}$.  The only positive integer that lies between $\\sqrt{40}$ and $-\\sqrt{40}$ is 6.  Since $x+3=6$, we have $x = \\boxed{3}$ as the only solution.",
