                "content": "If the variables $a$ and $b$ are inversely proportional, we can write the equation $ab = k$, where $k$ is a constant.\n\nFrom the information given in the problem, we can set up a system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\na + b &= 24, \\\\\na - b &= 6.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving for $a$ in the second equation, we find $a = b + 6.$ Substituting this into the first equation to eliminate $a$, we have $(b + 6) + b = 24.$\n\nCombining like terms gives $2b + 6 = 24$, so $2b = 18.$ Dividing by 2, we find $b = 9.$\n\nWhen $a = 5,$ we have the equation $5b = k.$\n\nSubstituting $b = 9,$ we have $5(9) = k,$ so $k = 45.$\n\nSubstituting $k = 45$ into the equation $ab = 45,$ we have $5(9) = 45,$ which is true.\n\nTherefore, $b = \\boxed{9}$ when $a = 5.$",
