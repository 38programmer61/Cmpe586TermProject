                "content": "The ball hits the ground for the first time after falling 100 feet. It then rebounds half of that distance, so it travels 100/2 = <<100/2=50>>50 feet after the first bounce.\nFor the second bounce, the ball will fall 50 feet and then rebound half that distance, so it will travel an additional 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 feet after the second bounce.\nFor the third bounce, the ball will fall 25 feet and rebound half that distance, so it will travel an additional 25/2 = <<25/2=12.5>>12.5 feet after the third bounce.\nFinally, for the fourth bounce, the ball will fall 12.5 feet and rebound half that distance, so it will travel an additional 12.5/2 = <<12.5/2=6.25>>6.25 feet.\nTherefore, the ball will have traveled 100 + 50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 = <<100+50+25+12.5+6.25=193.75>>193.75 feet when it hits the ground the fourth time. Answer: \\boxed{193.75}.",
