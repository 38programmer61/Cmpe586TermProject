    "problem": "Find the smallest positive integer $b$ for which $x^2+bx+2008$ factors into a product of two binomials, each having integer coefficients.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The question implies that we can factor the given quadratic as \\begin{align*}\nx^2+bx+2008 &= (x+r)(x+s)\\\\\n& = x^2+(r+s)x+rs, \\end{align*} where $r$ and $s$ are integers.  Since both $b$ and 2008 are positive, it is clear that $r$ and $s$ must also be positive.  By multiplying out the right-hand side as shown, we see that we must have $rs=2008$, which has prime factorization $2008=2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 251$.  Recall that we are trying to minimize $b=r+s$.  The best we can do is to let $r=251$ and $s=8$, leading to $b=251+8=\\boxed{259}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since the binomials we are looking for have integer coefficients, their constant terms must be divisors of $2008=2^3\\cdot251$, which are $\\pm1$, $\\pm2$, $\\pm4$, $\\pm8$, $\\pm251$, $\\pm502$, $\\pm1004$, $\\pm2008$. Since the coefficient of $x$ is $b$, the two binomials must be $(x+r)(x+s)$, where $r+s=b$.\n\nThe pairwise products of these numbers are $r+s=1\\cdot2008=2\\cdot1004=4\\cdot502=8\\cdot251=2\\cdot1004=4\\cdot502=8\\cdot251=251\\cdot8=502\\cdot4=1004\\cdot2$, with the second factor increasing each time. We observe that only $502\\cdot4$ and $251\\cdot8$ differ by an even power of $2$. Specifically,\n\\begin{align*} 502\\cdot4-251\\cdot8&=2(502\\cdot2-251\\cdot4) \\\\ &=2(1004-1004) \\\\ &=0. \\end{align*}\nThis means it is impossible for the pairwise products with numbers of different magnitudes to differ by a power of $2$: if $(a_m\\cdot b_n-b_m\\cdot a_n)\\equiv0\\pmod{2^k}$, with $a_m>a_n$ and $b_m>b_n$, then $2^k$ divides\n\\[a_m\\cdot(b_m-b_n)-a_n\\cdot(b_m-b_n)=(a_m-a_n)(b_m-b_n),\\]\nwhich means $2^k$ divides $(a_m-a_n)$ or $(b_m-b_n)$. Therefore, we can only consider whether the pairwise products of $r+s=251\\cdot8=2008$ contain differences of consecutive powers of $2$. Indeed,\n\\[(251+8)\\cdot(251-8)=259\\cdot243=3^5\\cdot2^5=243\\cdot2^3\\cdot2^2=8\\cdot2^8.\\]\nSince this is our smallest solution,\n\\[b=251+8=\\boxed{259}\\]."
