    "problem": "Homewood Middle School has 1200 students, and 730 of these students attend a summer picnic. If two-thirds of the girls in the school and one-half of the boys in the school attend the picnic, how many girls attend the picnic?  (Assume that each student in the school is either a boy or a girl.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the number of girls at HMS be $g$ and the number of boys be $b$. Thus, the total number of students implies $g + b = 1200$ and the attendance figures imply $\\frac{2}{3} g + \\frac{1}{2} b = 730$. Multiplying the first equation by 3 and subtracting that from the second equation multiplied by 6, we get $g = 780$. And, the number of girls who attended the picnic is $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 780 = \\boxed{520}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let G be the number of girls at the school and B be the number of boys.\nWe know that G + B = 1200 and G/3 + B/2 = 730.\nMultiplying the second equation by 6, we get G*2 + B*3 = 4380.\nMultiplying the first equation by 2, we get G*2 + B*2 = 2400.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get G = 1980.\nThus, 1980/3 = <<1980/3=660>>660 girls attend the picnic. Answer: \\boxed{660}."
