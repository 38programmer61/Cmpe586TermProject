    "solution": "We begin by writing $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $16$ as powers of $2$. \\begin{align*}\n(2^{-2})^{2x+8} & = (2^4)^{2x+5} \\\\\n2^{-4x-16} & = 2^{8x + 20} \\\\\n-4x - 16 & = 8x + 20 \\\\\nx & = \\boxed{-3}\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "First we can rewrite $16$ as $4^2$ so that the equation now reads $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{2x+8} = (4^2)^{2x+5}$. We can use the rule $a^{bc} = (a^b)^c$ to rewrite this as $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{2x+8} = 4^{4x+10}$. This can be written as $\\frac{1}{4^{2x+8}}= \\frac{4^{4x+10}}{1}$. Next, we can rewrite $\\frac{4^{4x+10}}{1}$ as $4^{4x+10}$. This will allow us to combine the left side with the right side. So the equation is now $\\frac{1}{4^{2x+8}}= 4^{4x+10}$. Since the bases of the two fractions are equal, the exponents must also be equal, so $2x+8 = 4x+10$.  Subtracting $2x$ and $10$ from each side gives $-2 = 2x$, so $x = \\boxed{-1}$."
