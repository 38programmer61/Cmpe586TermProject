    "problem": "A motel bills its customers by charging a flat fee for the first night and then adding on a fixed amount for every night thereafter. If it costs George $\\$155$ to stay in the motel for 3 nights and Noah $\\$290$ to stay in the motel for 6 nights, how much is the flat fee for the first night?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $f$ be the flat fee for the first night and $n$ be the fixed fee for each night thereafter. Notice that the first night is incorporated into the flat fee. We can create a system of two equations to represent the given information as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf + 2n &= 155 \\\\\nf + 5n &= 290 \\\\\n\\end{align*}It's easiest to eliminate $f,$ solve for $n$ and then solve for $f$ using that value. To solve for $n$, subtract the first equation from the second, obtaining $3n = 135$, or $n = 45$. Substitute for $n$ in the first equation to obtain $f = 155 - 90$, or $f = 65$. Thus, the flat fee for the first night is $\\boxed{\\$65}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let $f$ be the flat fee for the first night and let $r$ be the additional amount charged per night. Then the total bill for George is $f+2r$ and the total bill for Noah is $f+5r$. Because George;s bill was $\\$155$ and Noah's bill was $\\$290$, we have \\begin{align*}\nf+2r &= 155\\quad\\text{and}\\\\\nf+5r &= 290.\n\\end{align*}Multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting the second equation gives  \\begin{align*}\n2f+4r-\\left(f+5r\\right) &= 310-290\\\\\nf- r &=20.\n\\end{align*}Replacing $f$ in terms of $r$ in the equation $f+2r=155$ gives $(r+20) +2r=155$,  which reduces to $3r=135$ and, $r=45$. Replacing $r$ by 45 in the equation $f-r=20$ gives $f=65$. Thus, the flat fee is $\\boxed{65}$ dollars."
