    "problem": "For what value of $x$ does $3^{2x^{2}-5x+2} = 3^{2x^{2}+7x-4}$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If $3^{2x^{2}-5x+2} = 3^{2x^{2}+7x-4}$, then $2x^{2}-5x+2 = 2x^{2}+7x-4$.  We can eliminate the $2x^2$ term from each side and solve $-5x+2=7x-4$ for $x$ to get $x=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We begin by using the fact that $a=b$ if and only if $a^c = b^c$ and rewrite the equation as $2x^2 - 5x + 2 = 2x^2 + 7x - 4$. Simplifying this equation gives $12x = 6$, so $x = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
