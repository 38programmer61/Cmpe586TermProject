                "content": "Let's call the three different numbers $x$, $y$, and $z$. We are given the following information:\n\n$x + y + z = 67$\n$y - x = 7$\n$z - y = 3$\n\nFrom the second equation, we can rearrange it to get $y = x + 7$. Similarly, from the third equation, we have $z = y + 3 = (x + 7) + 3 = x + 10$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the first equation, we get:\n\n$x + (x + 7) + (x + 10) = 67$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we have:\n\n$3x + 17 = 67$\n\nSubtracting 17 from both sides, we get:\n\n$3x = 50$\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we have:\n\n$x = \\frac{50}{3}$\n\nHowever, since we are looking for whole numbers and the numbers are said to be different, $\\frac{50}{3}$ is not a valid value. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.",
