    "problem": "The sum of the first four terms of an arithmetic sequence is $10$. If the fifth term is $5$, what is the sixth term?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the common difference between any two consecutive terms $x$. We can express the first four terms in terms of $x$ and the fifth term: The fourth term is $5-x$, the third is $5-2x$, etc. So, we have $(5-4x) + (5-3x) + (5-2x) + (5-x) = 10$, which simplifies to $-10x = -10$, or $x = 1$. So the sixth term is $5+1 = \\boxed{6}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be $a$, and let the common difference be $d$.  Since the sum of the first four terms is 10, we have $a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) = 10$.  Expanding the left side gives $4a + 6d = 10$.  Since the fifth term is 5, we have $a + 4d = 5$.  Substituting $a = 5 - 4d$ from the second equation into the first equation to eliminate $a$ gives $4(5 - 4d) + 6d = 10$, or $20 - 16d + 6d = 10$.  Solving this equation gives $d = \\frac{5}{6}$.  Substituting $d = \\frac{5}{6}$ into $a + 4d = 5$ gives $a = 5 - 4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{5}{3}$.  The sixth term is then $a + 5d = \\frac{5}{3} + 5 \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{20}{3}}$."
