    "solution": "When using the distributive property for the first time, we add the product of $2x+3$ and $x$ to the product of $2x+3$ and 5:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(2x+3)(x+5) &= (2x+3) \\cdot x + (2x+3) \\cdot 5\\\\\n&= x(2x+3) + 5(2x+3)\n\\end{align*}We use the distributive property again and combine like terms:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx(2x+3) + 5(2x+3) &= 2x^2 + 3x + 10x+ 15\\\\\n&= \\boxed{2x^2 + 13x + 15}\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "To expand the product, we need to multiply each term in the first expression by each term in the second expression. \n\nStarting with the first term in the first expression, $2x$, we multiply it by each term in the second expression: \n\n$2x \\cdot x = 2x^2$\n\n$2x \\cdot 5 = 10x$\n\nNext, we move on to the second term in the first expression, $3$, and multiply it by each term in the second expression: \n\n$3 \\cdot x = 3x$\n\n$3 \\cdot 5 = 15$\n\nNow we collect all the terms to get the expanded product: \n\n$(2x+3)(x+5) = 2x^2 + 10x + 3x + 15$. \n\nFinally, we combine like terms: \n\n$2x^2 + 10x + 3x + 15 = 2x^2 + 13x + 15$. \n\nTherefore, the expanded product is $2x^2 + 13x + 15$."
