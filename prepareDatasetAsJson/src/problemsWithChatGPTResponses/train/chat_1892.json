                "content": "Let the dimensions of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$ with $l < w$. The area of the rectangle is $lw$ and the perimeter is $2l + 2w$. Setting the two equal gives $lw = 2l + 2w$. Dividing by $2lw$ gives $\\frac{1}{w} + \\frac{1}{l} = \\frac{1}{2}$, where $w$ and $l$ are integers. This expression rearranges to $2w + 2l = wl$. The left side of this equation is even, so $wl$ is even as well. Thus, at least one of $w$ and $l$ is even. Without loss of generality, let $l$ be even. Then $l$ is at least 2, and dividing by 2 in the equation above gives $w + l = \\frac{wl}{2}$. Since $l$ and $w$ are positive integers, $w + l$ must be strictly greater than $\\frac{wl}{2}$. However, this contradicts the given, so there are $\\boxed{0}$ non-square rectangles that satisfy the given. The rectangle of length 0 and width 0 is not considered a valid rectangle.",
