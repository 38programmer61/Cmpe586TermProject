    "chatgpt_solution": "In general, we can determine whether two lines are perpendicular by checking if the product of their slopes is $-1.$\n\nThe slope-intercept form of a line is of the form $y = mx+b$ for some real numbers $m$ and $b,$ and it is clear that the slope of the graph $y=mx+b$ is $m.$ Therefore, given a line in the form $Ax+By+C=0,$ we can determine the slope of the graph as $-\\frac{A}{B}.$\n\nThe slope-intercept form of the line $2y + x + 3 = 0$ is $y = -\\frac{1}{2} x - \\frac{3}{2},$ and the slope-intercept form of the line $3y + ax + 2 = 0$ is $y = -\\frac{a}{3} x - \\frac{2}{3}.$  Thus, the slopes of these two lines are $-\\frac{1}{2}$ and $-\\frac{a}{3},$ respectively.
