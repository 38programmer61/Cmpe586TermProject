    "problem": "The sum of three numbers $x$ ,$y$, $z$ is 165. When the smallest number $x$ is multiplied by 7, the result is $n$. The value $n$ is obtained by subtracting 9 from the largest number $y$. This number $n$ also results by adding 9 to the third number $z$. What is the product of the three numbers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We are given $x+y+z=165$, $n=7x = y-9 = z+9$.  Solving the last three equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$, respectively, and substituting into the first equation, we have $n/7+(n+9)+(n-9)=165$, which implies $n=77$.  Therefore, the three numbers are 11, 68, and 86.  The product of 11, 68, and 86 is $\\boxed{64,\\!328}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We are told that $x+y+z=165$, and we are given that $7x=n$, $y-9=n$, and $z+9=n$. These equations allow us to solve the system \\begin{align*}\nx+\\frac{n}{7}+\\frac{n-9}{5}&=165\\\\\n\\text{so }\\qquad 7x+\\frac{7n}{7}+\\frac{7(n-9)}{5}&=7\\cdot165\\\\\n\\text{so } \\qquad n+7(n-9)&=7\\cdot165\\\\\n\\text{so } \\qquad n+7n-63&=1155\\\\\n\\text{so } \\qquad 8n&=1218\\\\\n\\text{so } \\qquad n&=152.25.\n\\end{align*}This is close to 154. Because $n$ is defined as $y-9$ in the given information, we look for values of $y$ near 163. $x=\\frac{n}{7}=21.75$ is very close to 22, and $z=n-9=143.25$ is very close to 143, so our three numbers are 22, 143, and 154. Their product is $22\\cdot143\\cdot154=\\boxed{570972}$."
