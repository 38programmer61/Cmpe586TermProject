    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We only need to worry about the terms that multiply to have a degree of $2$. This would be given by the product of the terms $3x^2$ and $-4$ as well as the product of the terms $-2x$ and $-7x$. Thus, $$(3x^2) \\times (-4) + (-2x) \\times (-7x) = -12x^2 + 14x^2 = 2x^2,$$and the coefficient is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We only need to look at terms $x^2y^0$ in the product $(ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)(bx^2 - 7x - 4)$ because these are the only terms that will contribute an $x^2$ when multiplied together. The $x^2y^0$ terms we get are\n\\begin{align*}\n(ax^3)(bx^2) &= abx^5, \\\\\n(ax^3)(-7x) &= -7ax^4, \\\\\n(ax^3)(-4) &= -4ax^3, \\\\\n(3x^2)(bx^2) &= 3bx^4, \\\\\n(3x^2)(-7x) &= -21x^3, \\\\\n(3x^2)(-4) &= -12x^2, \\\\\n(-2x)(bx^2) &= -2bx^3, \\\\\n(-2x)(-7x) &= 14x^2, \\quad \\text{and} \\\\\n(-2x)(-4) &= 8x.\n\\end{align*}This means that the $x^2$ term in the expansion is \\[abx^5 - 7ax^4 - 4ax^3 + 3bx^4 - 21x^3 - 12x^2 - 2bx^3 + 14x^2 + 8x = \\boxed{-(7a+19)x^4 + (3b-21)x^3 + (2 - 7a + 14)x^2 + 8x}.\\]"
