    "problem": "A rectangular room has a perimeter of 42 feet and an area of 108 square feet. What is the length, in feet, of the shorter side?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the longer side have length $a$ and the shorter side have length $b$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n2a+2b&=42\\\\\nab&=108\n\\end{align*} From Equation (1), we have $a+b=21$, so $a=21-b$. Substituting that into Equation (2) to eliminate $a$, we get \\begin{align*}\n(21-b)(b)&=108\\\\\n21b-b^2&=108\\\\\nb^2-21b+108&=0\n\\end{align*} Factoring the equation, we get $(b-9)(b-12)=0$, so $b=9$ or $b=12$. $b=12$ corresponds to the longer side, so the length of the shorter side is $\\boxed{9}$ feet.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the shorter side have length $a$, so the longer side has length $b$.  Since the perimeter is $42$, $2a+2b=42$, or $a+b=21$.  Since the area is $108$, $ab=108$.  We want to solve for $a$.\n\nThe graph of $a + b = 21$ is a straight line, and the graph of $ab = 108$ is a hyperbola, but we only need one point of intersection.  The point $(12,9)$ lies on both graphs.  Therefore, the length of the shorter side is $\\boxed{9}$ feet.\n\n[asy]\nimport graph;\n\nsize(5cm);\nreal ticklen=3;\nreal tickspace=2;\n\nreal tick(real x) {\n\ndraw((0,x)--(-ticklen,x));\nreturn x+tickspace;\n}\n\n\n\ntick(12);\ntick(9);\ndraw(shift((0,0))*(21,0)--(0,0)--(0,13));\ndraw(shift((0,0))*(0,12)--(0,0)--(24,0));\nfill((16,2)--(16,10)--(8,10)--(8,2)--cycle,gray(0.7));\n\nlabel(\"$a$\",(5,0),S);\nlabel(\"$b$\",(0,6),W);\n\ndraw(graph(x+21,(84-3*x)/4),Arrows(4));\ndraw(graph((432-3*x)/28,x),Arrows(4));\nlabel(\"$ab=108$\", (15,6.5));\nlabel(\"$a+b=21$\", (5,10));\n[/asy]"
