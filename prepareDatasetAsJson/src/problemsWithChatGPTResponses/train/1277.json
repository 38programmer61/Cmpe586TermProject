    "problem": "When Frederick was born, his grandparents gave him a gift of $\\$2000$, which was invested at an interest rate of $5\\%$ per year, compounded yearly.  How much money will Frederick have when he collects the money at the age of $18$? Give your answer to the nearest hundredth of a dollar.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Five percent growth corresponds to multiplication by $1+5\\%=1.05$.  So, the amount of money Frederick will have in $18$ years is $2000(1+.05)^{18}=\\boxed{\\$4813.24}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "After $18$ years, at the age of $18$, the money will have had $18$ years to compound.  Therefore, the amount of money that Frederick will have is the principal, $P$, multiplied by one plus the interest rate, $r$, compounded $n$ times a year, raised to the power of $nt$, where $n$ is the number of times a year the interest is compounded, and $t$ is the number of years the money is invested for.  Hence, at the age of $18$, Frederick will have a total of $\\$2000\\left(1+\\dfrac{.05}{1}\\right)^{1\\cdot 18}$ dollars.  Evaluating this expression, we find the amount to be $\\$2000(1.05)^{18} = 2000(1.05^{10.5})\\approx \\boxed{\\$5997.36}$."
