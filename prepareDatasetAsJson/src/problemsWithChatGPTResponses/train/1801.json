    "problem": "The graphs of $y=3-x^2+x^3$ and $y=1+x^2+x^3$ intersect in multiple points.  Find the maximum difference between the $y$-coordinates of these intersection points.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The graphs intersect when the $y$-values at a particular $x$ are equal.  We can find this by solving \\[3-x^2+x^3=1+x^2+x^3.\\]This simplifies to  \\[2(x^2-1)=0.\\]This has two solutions, at $x=1$ and $x=-1$.  The $y$-coordinates for these points are  \\[1+1^2+1^3=3\\]and \\[1+(-1)^2+(-1)^3=1.\\]The difference between these values is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We find that $y=3-x^2+x^3$ and $y=1+x^2+x^3$ intersect when $2x^2 - 2 = 0$.  This gives us $x = \\pm 1$.  When $x = 1$, the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points are $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$ and $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$, so the maximum difference between $y$-coordinates is 0.  When $x = -1$, the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points are $3 - 1 - 1 = 1$ and $1 + 1 - 1 = 1$, so again, the maximum difference between $y$-coordinates is $\\boxed{0}$."
