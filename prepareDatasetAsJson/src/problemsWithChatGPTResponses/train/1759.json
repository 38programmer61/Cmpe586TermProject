    "problem": "Let $\\#$ be the relation defined by $A \\# B = A^2 + B^2$. If $A \\# 5 = 169$, what is the positive value of $A$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Using the definition given in the problem, we have $A^2+5^2=169=13^2$. Recognizing this as Pythagorean Theorem for a 5-12-13 right triangle, $A=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We have that $A \\# 5 = A^2 + 5^2 = 169$. Expanding the left and substracting 169 from both sides, we get $A^2 - 144 = (A - 12)(A + 12) = 0$. Since the problem asks for the positive value of $A$, we obtain $A=\\boxed{12}$."
