    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We use the distance formula on each pair of points.\nFrom $A$ to $B$: $\\sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (8-2)^2} = 6$\nFrom $B$ to $C$: $\\sqrt{(5-1)^2 + (5-8)^2} = \\sqrt{16+9} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$\nFrom $C$ to $A$: $\\sqrt{(5-1)^2 + (5-2)^2} = \\sqrt{16+9} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$\nAdding the three side lengths of the triangle together, we get $6+5+5=\\boxed{16}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "For a triangle $ABC$, with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, the perimeter of the triangle is just $a+b+c$. To find the side lengths of the triangle, we can use the distance formula. \n\nThe distance between $A(1,2)$ and $B(1,8)$ is $\\sqrt{(1-1)^2+(8-2)^2}=\\sqrt{0+36}=6$.\n\nThe distance between $B(1,8)$ and $C(5,5)$ is $\\sqrt{(5-1)^2+(5-8)^2}=\\sqrt{16+9}=\\sqrt{25}=5$.\n\nThe distance between $C(5,5)$ and $A(1,2)$ is $\\sqrt{(1-5)^2+(2-5)^2}=\\sqrt{16+9}=\\sqrt{25}=5$.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $AB+BC+AC=6+5+5=\\boxed{16}$."
