    "problem": "A squirrel travels at a constant 4 miles per hour. How long does it take for this squirrel to travel 1 mile? Express your answer in minutes.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Using the formula $time = \\frac{distance}{rate}$, we see that it takes the squirrel $\\frac{1}{4}$ hour to travel 1 mile. This is equal to $\\boxed{15}$ minutes.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "To find how long it takes for the squirrel to travel 1 mile, we need to divide the distance by the speed. \n\nSince the squirrel travels at a constant rate of 4 miles per hour, it will take 1/4 hour to travel 1 mile.\n\nTo convert this to minutes, we need to multiply by 60 to get 1/4 * 60 = 15 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it takes the squirrel 15 minutes to travel 1 mile. Answer: \\boxed{15}."
