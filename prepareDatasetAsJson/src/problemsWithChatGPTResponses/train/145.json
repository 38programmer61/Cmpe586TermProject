    "problem": "What is the sum of the solutions of the equation $(3x+5)(2x-9) = 0$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Expanding the left hand side of the given equation, we have $6x^2-17x-45=0$. Since for a quadratic with the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the sum of the solutions is $-b/a$, the sum of the solutions of the given equation is $-\\frac{-17}{6}=\\boxed{\\frac{17}{6}}$.  (We also could have simply noted that the roots are $-5/3$ and $9/2$, and added these, but who likes adding fractions?)",
    "chatgpt_solution": "$3x+5=0$ when $x=-\\frac{5}{3}$, and $2x-9=0$ when $x=\\frac{9}{2}$. The sum of the solutions is $-\\frac{5}{3} +\\frac{9}{2} =\\boxed{\\frac{7}{6}}$."
