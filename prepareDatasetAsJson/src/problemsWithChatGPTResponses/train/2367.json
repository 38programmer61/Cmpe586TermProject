    "problem": "What is the slope of the line $2y = -3x + 6$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives $y = -\\frac{3}{2}x + 3$, which is in slope-intercept form.  The coefficient of $x$ is the desired slope, $\\boxed{-\\frac32}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Solving for $y$, we find $y = -\\frac{3}{2} x + 3$.  The coefficient of $x$ is $-\\frac{3}{2}$, so the slope is $\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{2}}.$"
