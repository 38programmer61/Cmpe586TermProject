    "problem": "A pen and its ink refill together cost $\\;\\$1.10$. The pen costs $\\;\\$1$ more than the ink refill. What is the cost of the pen in dollars?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Begin by assigning variables.  Let $p$=the cost of the pen and $i$=the cost of the ink.  From what we are given,\n\\begin{align*}\np+i&=1.10,\\\\\np&=1+i.\n\\end{align*} Substituting for $p$ in the first equation, we find: $1+i+i=1.10$, so $2i=.10$ and $i=.05$. Therefore, $p=1+i=\\boxed{1.05}$ dollars.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the cost of the pen in dollars be $x$. Since the pen costs $\\$1$ more than the ink refill, the cost of the ink refill is $x-1$ dollars. Therefore, we have the equation $x+(x-1)=1.10$. Combining like terms on the left side of the equation gives $2x-1=1.10$. Adding $1$ to both sides of the equation, we have $2x=2.10$. Finally, dividing both sides of the equation by $2$ yields $x=\\boxed{1.05}$."
