                "content": "Let $x$ be the difference between consecutive terms in the arithmetic sequence in the row of squares, $y$ be the difference between consecutive terms in the arithmetic sequence in the first column of squares, and $z$ be the difference between consecutive terms in the arithmetic sequence in the second column of squares. From the diagram, we can construct three equations:  \\begin{align*}\n21+5x&=N \\\\\n14+2y&=N \\\\\n18+3z&=N\n\\end{align*} We can solve for $N$ by setting the three expressions equal to each other: \\begin{align*}\n21+5x&=14+2y \\\\\n14+2y&=18+3z \\\\\n21+5x&=18+3z\n\\end{align*} Solving the first two equations yields $\\begin{array}{l l}y=3x,&(1) \\\\ z=4y,&(2)\\end{array}$ but substitution gives $z=4(3x)=12x$. The third equation yields $21+5x=18+3(12x)$. Simplifying yields $-33x=-9$, so $x=\\frac{3}{11}$. Since $y=3x$, $y=\\frac{3}{11}\\cdot3=\\frac{9}{11}$. Substituting into the first equation gives $21+5\\left(\\frac{3}{11}\\right)=N+\\frac{9}{11}$, so $N=21+\\frac{15}{11}-\\frac{9}{11}=\\frac{216}{11}$. Thus, $N=\\boxed{216}$.",
