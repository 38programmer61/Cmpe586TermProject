    "problem": "Line $a$ is parallel to line $y=2x+4$ and passes through the point $(2,5)$. What is the y-intercept of line $a$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Two lines that are parallel have the same slope. Therefore, the slope of line $a$ is $2$. Using the point-slope formula, we get that the equation for line $a$ is $y-5=2(x-2)=2x-4$. In slope-intercept form, the equation is $y=2x+1$. Therefore, the y-intercept is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since we know that line $a$ is parallel to line $y=2x+4$ and passes through the point $(2,5)$, line $a$ must have the same slope as line $y=2x+4$. The slope-intercept form of a line is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. So, parallel lines must have the same slope. This means that the slope of line $a$ is $m = 2$. We can substitute the slope and point $(2, 5)$ into the slope-intercept form to find the $y$-intercept: \\begin{align*}\ny &= 2x + b\\\\\n5 &= 2(2) + b\\\\\n5 &= 4 + b\\\\\n5 - 4 &= b\\\\\n1 &= b.\n\\end{align*} The $y$-intercept of line $a$ is $\\boxed{1}$."
