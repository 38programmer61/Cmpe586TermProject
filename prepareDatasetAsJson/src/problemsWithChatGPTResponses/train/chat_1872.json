                "content": "Let's assume the number of acrobats is A and the number of elephants is E.\nEach acrobat has 2 legs, so the total number of legs contributed by acrobats is 2A.\nEach elephant has 4 legs, so the total number of legs contributed by elephants is 4E.\nFrom the information given, we know that the total number of legs is 40, so we can write the equation 2A + 4E = 40.\nWe also know that the total number of heads is 15, so we can write the equation A + E = 15.\nWe can solve this system of equations by substituting A = 15 - E into the first equation:\n2(15 - E) + 4E = 40\n30 - 2E + 4E = 40\n2E = 10\nE = 5\nSubstituting this value back into the equation A + E = 15:\nA + 5 = 15\nA = 10\nTherefore, you saw 10 acrobats in the show. Answer: \\boxed{10}.",
