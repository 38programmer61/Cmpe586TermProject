    "problem": "The equation $y=-4.9t^2+3.5t+5$ describes the height (in meters) of a ball thrown upward at $3.5$ meters per second from $5$ meters above the ground, where $t$ is the time in seconds. In how many seconds will the ball hit the ground? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Setting $y$ to zero, we get the quadratic\n\\[-4.9t^2 + 3.5t + 5 = 0.\\]Multiplying both sides by $-10,$ we get\n\\[49t^2 - 35t - 50 = 0.\\]This quadratic factors as $(7t - 10)(7t + 5) = 0.$  As $t$ must be positive, we can see that $t = \\boxed{\\frac{10}{7}}.$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The equation $y=-4.9t^2+3.5t+5$ describes the height of the ball at any time $t$ in seconds. We need to find when the ball hits the ground, so we set $y$ to $0$ and solve: \\begin{align*}\n-4.9t^2+3.5t+5&=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=-4.9t^2+3.5t+5.\n\\end{align*} We can simplify this equation by multiplying by $10$ to eliminate the decimal: \\begin{align*}\n0&=10\\cdot0\\\\\n&=(10)(-4.9t^2+3.5t+5)\\\\\n&=-49t^2+35t+50.\n\\end{align*} Since the leading coefficient is $-49$, both roots will be in the form $\\frac{-B\\pm\\sqrt{B^2-4AC}}{2A}$ of the quadratic formula. Here, $A=-49$, $B=35$, and $C=50$. Therefore, $$t=\\frac{-35\\pm\\sqrt{35^2-4(-49)(50)}}{2(-49)}.$$Calculating, \\begin{align*}\nt&=\\frac{-35\\pm\\sqrt{1225-(-980)}}{-98}\\\\\n&=\\frac{-35\\pm\\sqrt{2205}}{-98}\\\\\n&=\\frac{-35\\pm 35\\sqrt{5}}{-98}\\\\\n&=\\frac{7(\\mp1\\pm\\sqrt{5})}{-14\\cdot7}\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{1\\mp\\sqrt{5}}{-2}}.\n\\end{align*}Both roots are negative, but we want the time when the ball hits the ground. Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{-2}}$."
