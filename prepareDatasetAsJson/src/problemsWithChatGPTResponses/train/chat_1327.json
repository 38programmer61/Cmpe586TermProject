                "content": "For real $r$, we can complete the square.  Shifting our focus from the quadratic term to the linear term, we find that $(5r^2)(40r)=200r^3$ has three times the cubic term.\n\nAlternatively, we could note that the quadratic coefficient $-5$ is slightly inconvenient; we'll make it more convenient with a little trial and error.  We can divide the polynomial by $-5$ getting $r^2-8r+\\frac{12}{5}$ so the $r^2$ coefficient becomes $1$.  That yields the quadratic with the maximum value of $\\boxed{\\frac{97}{5}}$.",
