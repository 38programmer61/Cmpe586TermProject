    "problem": "The height of a ball when it is thrown off a cliff can be represented by the equation $h=45-7t-6t^2$, where $t$ is time in seconds. In how many seconds will the ball reach a height of 25 feet?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If we plug in 25 for $h$, we get \\begin{align*} 25& =45-7t-6t^2\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6t^2+7t-20& =0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (3t-4)(2t+5)& =0\n\\end{align*}The two possible values of $t$ are $\\frac43$, and $-\\frac52$. Since the time can only be a positive value, the answer must be $\\boxed{\\frac43}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We set $h=25$ feet and solve for the corresponding $t$: \\begin{align*}\n25=45-7t-6t^2&\\implies 6t^2+7t-20=0\\\\\n&\\implies (2t+5)(3t-4)=0\\\\\n&\\implies t=-\\frac{5}{2}\\text{ or }t=\\frac{4}{3}.\n\\end{align*}We disregard the negative root because $t$ represents time. Thus, $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}\\text{ seconds}}$ or 1 and $\\frac{1}{3}$ seconds have elapsed."
