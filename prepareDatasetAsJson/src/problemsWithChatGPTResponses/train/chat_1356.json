                "content": "First we could find the sum of the arithmetic series from 1 to 20, inclusive, and double it: we know that the sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, and in this case that average is $\\frac{1+39}{2}=20$.  The number of terms is $10$, so the sum is $2(20)(10) = 400$.  There are ten terms in this sequence, so the sum is equal to $\\frac{400}{2}=\\boxed{200}$.",
