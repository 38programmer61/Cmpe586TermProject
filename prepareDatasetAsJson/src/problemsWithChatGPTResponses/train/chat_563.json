                "content": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(3,7)$, the quadratic can be written in the form\n\\[y = a(x - 3)^2 + 7.\\]We are told that $(-2,0)$ is one of the $x$-intercepts.  This means that when $x = -2,$ the expression becomes 0:\n\\[0 = a((-2) - 3)^2 + 7.\\]Then\n\\[0 = 25a + 7,\\]so $a = -\\frac{7}{25}.$\n\nThe general equation is then\n\\[y = -\\frac{7}{25} (x - 3)^2 + 7.\\]The other $x$-intercept occurs when $y = 0.$  Then\n\\[\\frac{7}{25} (x - 3)^2 = 7.\\]Dividing both sides by 7, we get\n\\[\\frac{1}{25} (x - 3)^2 = 1.\\]Then $(x - 3)^2 = 25.$  Since $x - 3 = 5$ has the other solution $x = 8,$ the other $x$-intercept is $\\boxed{8}.$",
