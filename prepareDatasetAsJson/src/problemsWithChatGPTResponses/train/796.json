    "problem": "Margo walks to her friend's house in 10 minutes. Using the same route, it takes Margo 20 minutes to get back home. If her average walking rate for the entire trip is 4 miles per hour, how many total miles did she walk?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Margo walked for a total of $10+20=30$ minutes, or 0.5 hours.  To find the total distance traveled, we can multiply the total time by the rate: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{distance}&=\\text{rate}\\times \\text{time} \\\\\n&=0.5\\times 4 \\\\\n&=\\boxed{2}\\text{ miles}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We need to remember that average speed is defined as total distance divided by total time.\nThe time for her trip is 10 minutes + 20 minutes = <<10+20=30>>30 minutes = <<30=0.5>>0.5 hours.\nWe know that she walks a total of 0.5 hours * 4 miles per hour = <<0.5*4=2>>2 miles. Answer: \\boxed{2}."
