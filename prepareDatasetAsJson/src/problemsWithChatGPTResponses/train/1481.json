    "problem": "Point $M(4,4)$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$. If point $A$ has coordinates $(8,4)$, what is the sum of the coordinates of point $B$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let point $B$ have coordinates $(x,y)$. We have the equations $(x+8)/2=4$ and $(y+4)/2=4$, or $x=0$ and $y=4$. Thus, the sum of coordinates of point $B$ is $0+4=\\boxed{4}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, the coordinates of $M$ are the average of the coordinates of $A$ and $B$.  Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of $B$ is twice the $x$-coordinate of $M$ minus the $x$-coordinate of $A$, which is $2(4) - 8 = 0$.\n\nSimilarly, the $y$-coordinate of $B$ is twice the $y$-coordinate of $M$ minus the $y$-coordinate of $A$, which is $2(4) - 4 = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of $B$ are $(0,4)$, so the sum of the coordinates of $B$ is $0+4 = \\boxed{4}$."
