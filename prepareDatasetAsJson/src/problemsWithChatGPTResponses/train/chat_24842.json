                "content": "Let \"x\" be the number of one dollar bills James has and \"y\" be the number of two dollar bills he has.\nThe total amount of money James has in one dollar bills is x dollars.\nThe total amount of money James has in two dollar bills is 2y dollars.\nThe total number of one dollar and two dollar bills James has is x + y.\nWe know that the total amount of money James has is 66 dollars.\nTherefore, the sum of the amounts of money James has in one and two dollar bills is x + 2y = 66.\nWe also know that the total number of one dollar and two dollar bills James has is 49.\nTherefore, x + y = 49.\nWe can solve this system of equations by substitution.\nFirst, we solve the second equation for y in terms of x:\ny = 49 - x.\nSubstituting this expression for y in terms of x into the first equation, we get:\nx + 2(49 - x) = 66.\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\nx + 2(49) - 2(x) = 66,\nx + 98 - 2x = 66,\n- x + 98 = 66,\n- x = - 32.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by -1, we get:\nx = 32.\nTherefore, James has 32 one dollar bills.
