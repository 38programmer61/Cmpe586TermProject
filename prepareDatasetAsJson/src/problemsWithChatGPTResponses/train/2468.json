    "problem": "Corn costs 99 cents per pound, and beans cost 45 cents per pound. If Shea buys 24 total pounds of corn and beans, and it costs $\\$18.09$, how many pounds of corn did Shea buy? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $c$ and $b$ be the number of pounds of corn and beans Shea buys, respectively. We can turn the givens into a two-variable, linear system: \\begin{align*}\nb+c&=24\\\\\n45b+99c&=1809\n\\end{align*} We can multiply the first equation by 45 and subtract it from the second to get $(99-45)c=1809-45(24)$, which reduces to $54c=729$ or $c=13.5$. So Shea buys $\\boxed{13.5\\text{ pounds}}$ of corn.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "For simplicity, we set up a system of equations to represent the given information. Let $c$ represent the number of pounds of corn purchased and $b$ represent the number of pounds of beans purchased. Therefore, $c + b = 24$ and $0.99c + 0.45b = 18.09$. We multiply the first equation by 99 cents to eliminate the decimals in the second equation to get $0.99c + 0.99b = 24 \\cdot 0.99$. Subtracting the new second equation from the old second equation gives $(0.99 - 0.99)c + (0.45 - 0.99)b = 18.09 - 23.76$, or $-0.54b = -5.67$. Dividing both sides by $-0.54$ yields $b = \\frac{-5.67}{-0.54} \\approx 10.5$. Since Shea bought 24 pounds of beans and corn combined, she must buy $24 - 10.5 = \\boxed{13.5}$ pounds of corn. The other pounds are purchased as beans."
