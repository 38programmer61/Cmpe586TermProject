    "problem": "If $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{x} + 2} = \\frac{3}{2}$, solve for $x$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Squaring both sides of the equation yields $\\frac 2x + 2 = \\frac 94$. Subtracting $2$ from both sides gives $\\frac 2x = \\frac 14$, so $x = \\boxed{8}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We begin by squaring both sides of the equation $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{x} + 2} = \\frac{3}{2}$.  This gives $\\frac{2}{x} + 2 = \\frac{9}{4}$, so $\\frac{2}{x} = \\frac{1}{4}$.  Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we find $\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1}{8}$.  Since $\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1}{8}$, we must have $x = \\boxed{8}$."
