                "content": "We have $8 = 2^3$, so we can rewrite the equation as $(2^3)^{4x-6} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+5}$. Using the property of exponents that $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$, the left-hand side becomes $2^{3(4x-6)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+5}$. Since $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^a = 2^{-a}$, we can also rewrite the right-hand side as $2^{-(x+5)}$. Thus, we have $2^{3(4x-6)} = 2^{-(x+5)}$. Because $f(x)=a^x$ is an increasing function when $a>1$, we must have $3(4x-6) = -(x+5)$. Expanding both sides gives $12x-18 = -x-5$. Adding $x$ and $18$ to both sides gives $13x = 13$, so $x = \\boxed{1}$.",
