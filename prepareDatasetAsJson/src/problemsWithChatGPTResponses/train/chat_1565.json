                "content": "Since we know that line $a$ is parallel to line $y=2x+4$ and passes through the point $(2,5)$, line $a$ must have the same slope as line $y=2x+4$. The slope-intercept form of a line is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. So, parallel lines must have the same slope. This means that the slope of line $a$ is $m = 2$. We can substitute the slope and point $(2, 5)$ into the slope-intercept form to find the $y$-intercept: \\begin{align*}\ny &= 2x + b\\\\\n5 &= 2(2) + b\\\\\n5 &= 4 + b\\\\\n5 - 4 &= b\\\\\n1 &= b.\n\\end{align*} The $y$-intercept of line $a$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
