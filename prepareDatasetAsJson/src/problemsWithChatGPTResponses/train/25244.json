    "problem": "Ivan rents a car for $\\$$25 a day and $\\$$0.20 a mile. If he rents it for 4 days and drives it 400 miles, how many dollars does he pay?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The cost of renting for four days is $25\\times4=100$ and the cost of driving $400$ miles is $.20\\times400=\\frac{400}{5}=80$. He has to pay $100+80=\\boxed{\\$180}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We multiply the number of days he rents the car by the rental rate per day to get 4 days * 25 dollars/day = <<4*25=100>>100 dollars for the number of days.\nWe multiply the number of miles he drives by the rental rate per mile to get 400 miles * 0.20 dollars/mile = <<400*0.20=80>>80 dollars for the mileage.\nThe total cost is 100 + 80 = <<100+80=180>>180 dollars. Answer: \\boxed{180}."
