                "content": "Let's say Shenille attempted $x$ three-point shots and $30-x$ two-point shots.  She made $0.2x$ three-pointers and $0.3(30-x)$ two-pointers.  In total, she scored $3(0.2x) + 2(0.3(30-x))$ points.  Since she made all of her shots, this adds up to $3(x-y)+2(3-y)$ points, and we want this to equal the total number of points scored, $30$.  Therefore, we have the equation  \\begin{align*}\n3(x-y)+2(3-y) &=30\\\\\n9x-8y &= 24.\n\\end{align*}We were also told that $x+y=30,$ which we can solve for $x$ to get $x=30-y$.  Substituting, we see that $(9(30-y)-8y)=24$.  Simplifying the left side gives $270-17y=24$.  Solving for $y$ gives $y=\\frac{270-24}{17}$, so $y=15.$  Therefore, Shenille made $15$ two-point shots and $30-15=15$ three-point shots, for a total of $2(15)=\\boxed{30}$ points.",
