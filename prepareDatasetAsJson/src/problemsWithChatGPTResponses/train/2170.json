    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the following inequalities are true, \\[\\sqrt{1}<\\sqrt{2}<\\sqrt{4} \\Rightarrow 1<\\sqrt{2}<2\\]\\[\\sqrt{16}<\\sqrt{22}<\\sqrt{25} \\Rightarrow 4<\\sqrt{22}<5\\]\\[\\sqrt{196}<\\sqrt{222}<\\sqrt{225} \\Rightarrow 14<\\sqrt{222}<15\\]the smallest integer greater than $\\sqrt{2}$ is $2$, the smallest integer greater than $\\sqrt{22}$ is $5$, and the smallest integer greater than $\\sqrt{222}$ is $15$. Therefore, $2+5+15=\\boxed{22}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Obviously $\\sqrt{2}<\\sqrt{22}<\\sqrt{222}$.\n\nSo looking just at the $\\sqrt{22}$ term, we know $\\sqrt{22}$ is between 4 and 5, inclusive. Quick mental estimation tells us it's closer to 5, so $\\lceil\\sqrt{22}\\,\\rceil=5$.\n\nThen $14<\\sqrt{222}<15$, but $\\lceil\\sqrt{222}\\,\\rceil=15$ as $\\sqrt{222}$ is extremely close to 15.\n\nFinally, the answer is $1+5+15=\\boxed{21}$."
