Therefore, the sequence can be written as:\n\n1,000,000, 1,000,000/2, (1,000,000/2)/2, ((1,000,000/2)/2)/2, ...\n\nTo find the last integer in this sequence, we need to continue dividing until we reach a value where the next division would result in a non-integer value.\n\n1,000,000/2 = 500,000\n500,000/2 = 250,000\n250,000/2 = 125,000\n125,000/2 = 62,500\n62,500/2 = 31,250\n31,250/2 = 15,625\n\nAt this point, the next division by 2 would result in a non-integer value since 15,625 \u00f7 2 = 7,812.5.
