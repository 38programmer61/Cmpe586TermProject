    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "For a quadratic to have only one solution, the discriminant must be zero. Therefore, we have $(-12)^2-4 \\cdot p \\cdot 4 = 0$. Solving, we get $(-12)^2-4 \\cdot p \\cdot 4 = 144-16p = 0$. Thus, $144=16p$, so $p=\\boxed{9}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since the discriminant of the quadratic is $(-12)^2-4(p)(4)=144-16p$, the quadratic has one solution if and only if its discriminant is equal to 0.  Hence \\begin{align*}\n144-16p &= 0\\\\\n16p &= 144\\\\\np &= \\boxed{9}.\n\\end{align*}"
