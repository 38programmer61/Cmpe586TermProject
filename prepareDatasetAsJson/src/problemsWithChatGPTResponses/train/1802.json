    "problem": "In the equation $|x-7| -3 = -2$, what is the product of all possible values of $x$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We rearrange the given equation to $|x-7| = 1$.  Thus either $x-7 = 1$, meaning $x = 8$, or $x-7 = -1$, meaning $x=6$.  Our answer is therefore $6\\cdot 8 = \\boxed{48}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We begin by adding 3 to both sides, which gives us $|x-7| = 1$. Since we are taking the absolute value of a quantity, the expression inside the absolute value bars must be either 1 or $-1$. If $x-7 = 1$, then $x=8$. If $x-7=-1$, then $x=6$. Thus, the possible values of $x$ are 8 and 6, and their product is $8\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{48}$."
