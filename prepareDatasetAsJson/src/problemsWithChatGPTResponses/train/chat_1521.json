                "content": "We could write $4^{x+1}$ as $(2^2)^{x+1}$, which simplifies to $2^{2x+2}$.  So our equation is now $2^{x-3} = 2^{2x+2}$. We could then simplify further using the property of exponentiation that $a^m = a^n$ implies $m = n$. Since $2^{x-3} = 2^{2x+2}$, we must have $x-3 = 2x+2$. This equation yields $x = \\boxed{-5}$.",
