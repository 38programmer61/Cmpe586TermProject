                "content": "Let's call the positive number x. \n\nAccording to the given information, the sum of the positive number and its square is 156. \n\nSo, we can write this as an equation: x + x^2 = 156. \n\nTo solve this equation, let's rearrange it into a quadratic equation: \nx^2 + x - 156 = 0. \n\nNow, we can factorize this quadratic equation: \n(x + 13)(x - 12) = 0. \n\nTo find the value of x, we need to set each factor equal to zero and solve for x: \n\nSetting x + 13 = 0, we get: \nx = -13. \n\nSetting x - 12 = 0, we get: \nx = 12. \n\nSince the question asks for a positive number, the only valid solution is x = 12. \n\nTherefore, the number is 12.",
