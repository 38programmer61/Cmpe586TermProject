    "solution": "Since $8=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{-3}$ the equation can be rewritten as $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{-3(4x-6)}=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+5}$. From this equation, we see that $-3(4x-6)=x+5$. Simplifying we get, \\begin{align*}\n-12x+18&=x+5\\\\\n\\Rightarrow -13x+18&=5\\\\\n\\Rightarrow -13x&=-13\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x&=\\boxed{1}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We have $8 = 2^3$, so we can rewrite the equation as $(2^3)^{4x-6} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+5}$. Using the property of exponents that $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$, the left-hand side becomes $2^{3(4x-6)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+5}$. Since $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^a = 2^{-a}$, we can also rewrite the right-hand side as $2^{-(x+5)}$. Thus, we have $2^{3(4x-6)} = 2^{-(x+5)}$. Because $f(x)=a^x$ is an increasing function when $a>1$, we must have $3(4x-6) = -(x+5)$. Expanding both sides gives $12x-18 = -x-5$. Adding $x$ and $18$ to both sides gives $13x = 13$, so $x = \\boxed{1}$."
