    "problem": "What is the sum of the even, positive integers less than 62?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We are summing up $2+4+6+\\cdots+60$. Factoring out a 2 and simplifying, we have $2(1+2+3+\\cdots+30)=2\\cdot\\frac{30\\cdot31}{2}=\\boxed{930}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The sum of an arithmetic series equals the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum of an arithmetic series equals $\\frac{a + l}{2}n$, where $a$ is the first term, $l$ is the last term, and $n$ is the number of terms.  Since there are $62/2=31$ even, positive integers less than 62, the sum we seek is $\\frac{2+60}{2}(31)=\\boxed{961}$."
