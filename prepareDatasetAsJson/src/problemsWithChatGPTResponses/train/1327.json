    "problem": "What is the maximum value of the expression $-5r^2 + 40r - 12$ for real $r$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We complete the square: \\begin{align*}\n-5r^2 + 40r - 12 & = (-5r^2 + 40r) - 12\\\\\n&= -5(r^2 - 8r + 16) -12 + 5 \\cdot 16\\\\\n&= -5(r - 4)^2 + 68\n\\end{align*} The maximum value of $-5(r-4)^2$ is $0$, since the square of a real number is never negative. Thus, the maximum value of the expression is $\\boxed{68}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "For real $r$, we can complete the square.  Shifting our focus from the quadratic term to the linear term, we find that $(5r^2)(40r)=200r^3$ has three times the cubic term.\n\nAlternatively, we could note that the quadratic coefficient $-5$ is slightly inconvenient; we'll make it more convenient with a little trial and error.  We can divide the polynomial by $-5$ getting $r^2-8r+\\frac{12}{5}$ so the $r^2$ coefficient becomes $1$.  That yields the quadratic with the maximum value of $\\boxed{\\frac{97}{5}}$."
