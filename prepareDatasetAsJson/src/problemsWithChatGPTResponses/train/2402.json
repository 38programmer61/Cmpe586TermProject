    "problem": "The sum of three different numbers is 67. The two larger numbers differ by 7 and the two smaller numbers differ by 3. What is the value of the largest number?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "$\\textbf{Solution 1}$: Let the three numbers be $a$, $b$, and $c$, and WLOG assume that $a\\le b \\le c$. We have the three equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c&=67\\\\\nc-b&=7\\\\\nb-a&=3\n\\end{align*} From the second equation, we have $c=b+7$. Substituting this into the first equation to eliminate $c$, we have $a+b+(b+7)=67\\Rightarrow a+2b=60$. Adding this last equation to the third equation, we have $a+2b+b-a=60+3\\Rightarrow b=21$. Substituting this value into the second equation to find $c$, we get $c=b+7=28$. Thus, the largest number is $\\boxed{28}$.\n\n$\\textbf{Solution 2}$: Let the middle number be $x.$ Then, the largest number is $x+7$ and the smallest number is $x-3.$ The numbers have a sum of $67,$ so we have the equation $$(x-3) + (x) + (x+7) = 67.$$ Simplifying, we get $$3x + 4 = 67$$ $$\\implies x = 21.$$ So, the largest number is $x+7 = 21+7 = \\boxed{28}.$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let's call the three different numbers $x$, $y$, and $z$. We are given the following information:\n\n$x + y + z = 67$\n$y - x = 7$\n$z - y = 3$\n\nFrom the second equation, we can rearrange it to get $y = x + 7$. Similarly, from the third equation, we have $z = y + 3 = (x + 7) + 3 = x + 10$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the first equation, we get:\n\n$x + (x + 7) + (x + 10) = 67$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we have:\n\n$3x + 17 = 67$\n\nSubtracting 17 from both sides, we get:\n\n$3x = 50$\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we have:\n\n$x = \\frac{50}{3}$\n\nHowever, since we are looking for whole numbers and the numbers are said to be different, $\\frac{50}{3}$ is not a valid value. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem."
