    "problem": "Solve for $x$: $3^{2x} = \\sqrt{27}$. Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Because $\\sqrt{27} = 27^{\\frac{1}{2}} = (3^3)^\\frac{1}{2} = 3^{\\frac{3}{2}}$, we have $3^{2x}=3^{\\frac{3}{2}}$.  This gives us $2x=\\frac{3}{2}$, so $x=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Writing both sides with 3 as the base gives us \\[\n3^{2x} = \\left(3^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\right)^2.\n\\]Since the bases are equal, the exponents must also be equal: $2x = \\left(3^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\right)^2 = 3^3 = 27$. Hence $x=\\boxed{\\frac{27}{2}}$."
