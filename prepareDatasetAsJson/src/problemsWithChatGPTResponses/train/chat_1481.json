Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of $B$ is twice the $x$-coordinate of $M$ minus the $x$-coordinate of $A$, which is $2(4) - 8 = 0$.\n\nSimilarly, the $y$-coordinate of $B$ is twice the $y$-coordinate of $M$ minus the $y$-coordinate of $A$, which is $2(4) - 4 = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of $B$ are $(0,4)$, so the sum of the coordinates of $B$ is $0+4 = \\boxed{4}$.",
