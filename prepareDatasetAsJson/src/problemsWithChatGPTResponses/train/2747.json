    "problem": "If $x^{2y}= 4$ and $x = 4$, what is the value of $y$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Plugging $x = 4$ into the first equation, we get $4^{2y} = 4^1 \\Rightarrow 2y = 1 \\Rightarrow y = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "If $x = 4$, then our equation reads $4^{2y} = 4$.  Since $4^2 = 16$, we have $16^y = 4$, or $y = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
