    "problem": "Four years ago you invested some money at $10\\%$ interest. You now have $\\$439.23$ in the account. If the interest was compounded yearly, how much did you invest 4 years ago?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the initial amount.  After four years, at a ten percent annual interest rate, the investment will have grown to $x \\cdot 1.1^4$, so $x \\cdot 1.1^4 = 439.23$.  Then $x = 439.23/1.1^4 = \\boxed{300}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let $P$ be the principal you invested four years ago.  After four years, at 10% annual interest compounded yearly, the account will have grown to $1.10^4 P = 1.4641P$.  Therefore we must solve the equation\n\\[1.4641P = 439.23.\\]Dividing both sides by $1.4641$, we find $P = \\boxed{300}$."
