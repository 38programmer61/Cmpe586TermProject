                "content": "Solving $|y|=2(|y|-1)$ is essentially solving $2|y|-1=|y|$. Splitting this equation into two cases, we consider when $y$ is nonnegative and when $y$ is negative. When $y$ is nonnegative, $2y - 1 = y$, so $y=1$. When $y$ is negative, $-2y-1 = -y$, so $y=-1$. Hence the solutions of the equation are $y=-1$ and $y=1$, and the product of the solutions is $(-1)(1) = \\boxed{-1}$.",
