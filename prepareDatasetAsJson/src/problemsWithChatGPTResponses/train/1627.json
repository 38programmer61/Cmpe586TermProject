    "problem": "What is the integer value of $y$ in the arithmetic sequence $2^2, y, 2^4$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The term $y$ is simply the average of $2^2 = 4$ and $2^4 = 16$, which is $(4 + 16)/2 = 20/2 = \\boxed{10}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since $y$ is between $2^2 = 4$ and $2^4 = 16$, the only possibility is $y = \\boxed{8}$."
