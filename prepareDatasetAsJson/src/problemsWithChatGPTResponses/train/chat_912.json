                "content": "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$ where $x>y$. Since the difference between the two numbers is 9, we have $x-y=9$. We are also given that the sum of the squares of each number is 153, so $x^2+y^2=153$. Notice that $(x-y)^2 = x^2-2xy+y^2$, so we can rewrite the first equation as $x^2-2xy+y^2 = 9^2$, or $x^2+y^2-2xy = 81$. Combining this with the second equation, we know that $x^2+y^2-2xy=81$, and $x^2+y^2=153$, so $-2xy=153-81$ and $xy = \\dfrac{153-81}{-2} = \\boxed{-36}$.",
