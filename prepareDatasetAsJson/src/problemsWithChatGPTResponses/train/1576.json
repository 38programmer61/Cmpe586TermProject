    "problem": "What is the $x$-intercept of the line perpendicular to the line defined by $3x-2y = 6$ and whose $y$-intercept is 2?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "By subtracting $3x$ and dividing both sides by $-2$ we get $y = \\frac 32 x - 3$ meaning this line has slope $\\frac{3}{2}$ and any line perpendicular to it has slope $-\\frac{2}{3}$.  Using the slope-intercept form of a line we get that the equation of the line perpendicular to it with $y$-intercept of 2 is $y = -\\frac{2}{3} x + 2$.  We find the $x$-intercept by letting $y = 0$ which gives $x = \\boxed{3}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We begin our solution by expressing the given line in slope-intercept form. We have $3x - 2y = 6$, or $2y = 3x - 6$, which means $y = \\frac32 x - 3$.  Since we want the line perpendicular to this one, we want its slope to be the negative reciprocal of $\\frac32$.  The negative reciprocal is $-\\frac{2}{3}$, so our line has slope $-\\frac23$.  This line also has a $y$-intercept of 2, so the line in slope-intercept form is $y = -\\frac23 x + 2$.  The $x$-intercept is the point $(x,0)$ at which this line intersects the $x$-axis.  Substituting 0 for $y$ in the equation $y = -\\frac23 x + 2$ gives us $0 = -\\frac23 x+2$.  Solving for $x$ gives us $x = \\boxed{3}$.
