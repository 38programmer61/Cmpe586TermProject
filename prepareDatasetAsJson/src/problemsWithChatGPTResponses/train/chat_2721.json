                "content": "Since we want to solve for $(u, v),$ we see that it is necessary to eliminate the variable $v.$ To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by $-1,$ so that we have the same coefficient for $v.$ Multiplying the first equation by 2 gives \\begin{align*}\n2\\cdot5u&=2\\cdot(-7-2v),\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 10u&=-14-4v.\n\\end{align*}Multiplying the second equation by $-1$ gives  \\begin{align*}\n-1\\cdot3u&=-1\\cdot(4v-25),\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -3u&=-4v+25.\n\\end{align*}Using the distributive property and combining like terms gives  \\begin{align*}\n10u&=-14-4v,\\\\ -3u&=-4v+25.\n\\end{align*}Thus, we have $-4v$ equal to $-4v$ in each equation, so we can set the two expressions equal to each other \\[-14-4v=-4v+25.\\]Simplifying gives $14=25,$ which is obviously false. Therefore, there must be no solution to the system of equations. Thus, there is $\\boxed{\\text{no solution}}$ to the system of equations.",
