    "problem": "Diana is three years younger than Eduardo. Eduardo is four years older than Chad. Faye is three years older than Chad. Diana is 14 years old. How many years old is Faye?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $C$, $D$, $E$, and $F$ denote the ages of Chad, Diana, Eduardo, and Faye.  We are given three equations. \\begin{align*}\nD&=E-3 \\\\\nE&=C+4 \\\\\nC+3&=F\n\\end{align*} Summing these three equations, we find that $E$ and $C$ cancel to leave $D+3=F+1$, which implies $F=D+2$.  Since $D=14$, we have $F=\\boxed{16}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since Diana is three years younger than Eduardo and Diana is already 14, then Eduardo is 14 + 3 = <<14+3=17>>17 years old.\nEduardo is four years older than Chad so Chad is 17 - 4 = <<17-4=13>>13 years old.\nFaye is three years older than Chad, so Faye is 13 + 3 = <<13+3=16>>16. Answer: \\boxed{16}."
