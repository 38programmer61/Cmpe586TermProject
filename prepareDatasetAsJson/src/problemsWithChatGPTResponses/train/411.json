    "problem": "What is the positive difference between the sum of the first 20 positive even integers and the sum of the first 15 positive odd integers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the first 20 positive even integers is $2 + 4 + \\dots + 40 = 2(1 + 2 + \\dots + 20)$.  For all $n$, $1 + 2 + \\dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so $2(1 + 2 + \\dots + 20) = 20 \\cdot 21 = 420$.\n\nThe sum of the first 15 positive odd integers is $1 + 3 + \\dots + 29$.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so this sum is equal to $(1 + 29)/2 \\cdot 15 = 225$.  The positive difference between these sums is $420 - 225 = \\boxed{195}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The sum of the first 20 positive even integers is $2+4+6+\\cdots + 38 + 40$. The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(1+20)\\left(\\frac{2+40}{2}\\right) = 10\\cdot 21 = 210$. Similarly, the sum of the first $n$ positive odd integers is $n^2$, so the sum of the first 15 positive odd integers is $1^2+3^2+\\cdots + 29^2 + 31^2 = 15^2 = 225$. The positive difference between these two sums is $225 - 210=\\boxed{15}$."
