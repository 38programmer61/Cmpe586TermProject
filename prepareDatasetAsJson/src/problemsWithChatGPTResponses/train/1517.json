    "solution": "This is an infinite geometric series with first term $a=1$ and common ratio $r=\\frac{1}{3}$. Thus the sum is: $$\\frac{a}{1-r} = \\frac{1}{1-\\frac13} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2}{3}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}.$$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Consider a geometric series with first term $a$ and common ratio $r$. Recall that the sum of the first $n$ terms of the geometric series is given by the formula $$S_n = \\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}.$$ In this particular series, we have $a=1$ and $r=1/3$. We want to find the sum of the entire series, so we let $n$ approach infinity. Since $|r| < 1$, the term $r^n$ approaches 0 as $n$ becomes arbitrarily large, so we have $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty } S_n = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty } \\frac{1(1-(1/3)^n)}{1-1/3} = \\frac{\\cancelto{0}{1-\\lim_{n \\to \\infty } (1/3)^n}}{2/3} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}.$$"
