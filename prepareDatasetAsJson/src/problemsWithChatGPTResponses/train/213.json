    "problem": "If $x$ is a real number and $x^2-7x+6<0$, what are the possible values for $x$? Use interval notation to express your answer.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Factoring the quadratic gives $(x-1)(x-6)<0$, which means that $x-1$ and $x-6$ must have opposite signs, since the product of two factors with the same sign is positive. Now, we split into four cases. If $x<1$, then both factors are negative. If $x>6$, both factors are positive. If $x=1$ or $x=6$, one of the factors is zero. If $1<x<6$, $x-6$ is negative and $x-1$ is positive, meaning the inequality is satisfied. So our only possible range is $1<x<6$, giving interval notation of $\\boxed{(1,6)}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We can factor the quadratic equation to obtain $(x-1)(x-6)<0$. We see that the quadratic is negative when the product $(x-1)(x-6)$ is negative. This occurs when either $(x-1)<0$ and $(x-6)>0$ or $(x-1)>0$ and $(x-6)<0$. The first case has $1<x<6$, and the second has $x<1$ or $x>6$. Combining these with an OR, we find $x \\in \\boxed{(1, 6)} \\cup \\boxed{(-\\infty, 1) \\cup (6, \\infty)}$."
