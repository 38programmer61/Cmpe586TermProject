    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Subtract 1/3 from 1/2 by finding a common denominator: \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{3}{6}-\\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{1}{6}.\n\\] Solving $\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{1}{x}$ we find $x=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "To solve for $x$, we can begin by simplifying the left side of the equation. Simplifying, we find that $$\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{6} - \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}.$$Therefore, we have the equation $$\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{x}.$$Multiplying both sides of the equation by $6x$, we find that $x = \\boxed{6}$."
