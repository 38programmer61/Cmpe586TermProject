                "content": "We begin by subtracting $5t$ and $6t$ from both sides: \\[\\frac{13t^2 - 34t + 12}{3t - 2} = -1.\\]Since we are dealing with a fraction, we take cases on the denominator of the fraction. There are two possible cases: $3t-2 = 0$ and $3t-2 \\neq 0.$\n\nIf $3t - 2 = 0,$ then $t = \\tfrac{2}{3}.$  We notice that $t = \\tfrac{2}{3}$ satisfies the original equation. (If a root is extraneous, it will not work in the original equation.)\n\nIf $3t-2\\neq0,$ then \\[\\frac{13t^2-34t+12}{3t-2} = -1 \\implies 13t^2 - 34t + 12 = -3t + 2.\\]Combining like terms, we get $13t^2 - 31t + 10 = 0.$ By the quadratic formula,  \\[t = \\frac{31\\pm\\sqrt{31^2-4\\cdot13\\cdot10}}{26},\\]and it is easy to check that both values of $t$ satisfy the original equation. (Note that in fact both roots turn out to be less than $\\tfrac23.$)\n\nIn summary, the solutions are $t = \\boxed{\\frac23}.$",
