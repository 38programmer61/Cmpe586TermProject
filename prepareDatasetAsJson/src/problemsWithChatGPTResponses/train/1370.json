    "problem": "It takes four painters working at the same rate $1.25$ work-days to finish a job. If only three painters are available, how many work-days will it take them to finish the job, working at the same rate? Express your answer as a mixed number.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The number of workers will be inversely proportional to the time needed to complete the job.  This means that the product $(\\text{number of workers})\\times(\\text{days to complete job})$ will be a constant.  In this case, that constant will be: $$4\\times 1.25=5$$ For three workers, the product will remain the same.  Let $D$ equal the number of days needed for three workers to complete the job.  Then, \\begin{align*}\n3\\times D&=5\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad D&=5/3=\\boxed{1\\frac{2}{3}} \\text{work-days}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since \"It takes four painters working at the same rate 1.25 work-days to finish a job,\" we know that these four painters together can complete $1$ job in $1.25$ days. Thus, in $1$ day, they can complete $\\frac{1}{1.25}=\\frac{4}{5}$ of the job, and so each of the four painters contribute $\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\frac{4}{5}=\\frac{1}{5}$ the job in one day.\n\nIn one day, three painters will contribute $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot3=\\frac{3}{5}$ of the job. Thus, we need $\\frac{5}{3}$ days for three workers to complete the job. But $\\frac{5}{3}=1\\frac{2}{3}$, which we recognize as the answer.\n\nFor a more intuitive solution, suppose the painters are invisible workers in Santa's \"Hoarder\" Warehouse, and that they paint $100$ identical chairs. When four painters are present, each will finish $\\frac{100}{4}=25$ chairs in a day. The three of them who show up will paint $75$ chairs on that day. Thus, it will take two days for three painters to complete the work with an average rate of $37.5\\%$ that of the four-worker crew."
