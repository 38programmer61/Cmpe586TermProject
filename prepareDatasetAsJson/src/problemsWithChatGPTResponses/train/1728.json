    "solution": "We consider two cases, $x$ is nonnegative (so $|x| = x$), and $x$ is negative (so $|x| = -x$).\n\nWhen $x\\ge 0,$ the equation becomes $x^2-2x-1=0$.  Applying the quadratic formula gives $ x=1\\pm\\sqrt{2}.$  However, $x$ must be nonnegative in this case, so we have $x = 1+\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWhen $x<0,$ the equation becomes $x^2+2x+1=0$, so $(x+1)^2 = 0$ and $x=-1$.\n\nThus, the smallest value of $x$ is $x=\\boxed{-1}.$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "First, note that because we want to minimize $x$, we can assume that $x > 0$. This means that $|x| = x$, so now our equation becomes $x^2 = 2x+1$. Rearranging and factoring, we find $x^2-2x-1 = 0$, and by the quadratic formula, $$x = \\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{4-4\\cdot (-1)}}{2} = 1\\pm \\sqrt{2}.$$The smallest solution is $\\boxed{1-\\sqrt{2}}$."
