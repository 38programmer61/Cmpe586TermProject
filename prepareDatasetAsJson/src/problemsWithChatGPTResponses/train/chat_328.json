                "content": "We could take logarithms to solve the problem, but because the bases are so nice (powers of $2$ and $16$, which happen to be powers of $2^4$) we can simplify \"by inspection.\"  Writing the equation $2^8=16^x$ in terms of powers of $2$ gives us $2^8=(2^4)^x=2^{4x}$, so $2^8=2^{4x}$.  We see that $x=\\boxed{2}$.",
