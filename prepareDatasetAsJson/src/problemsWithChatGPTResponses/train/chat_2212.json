                "content": "We notice a common pattern: we have sequential powers of $2013$ and $2014$ as the terms and coefficients of the numerator of a fraction. This is reminiscent of the binomial coefficients, more particularly the differences between consecutive combinations in Pascal's Triangle, which is a consequence of the Binomial Theorem. Thus, the numerator of the fraction, when expanded fully, will have a term for each entry in a row with $2015$ terms in Pascal's Triangle, and the vast majority of the terms in the numerator will cancel each other out, caused by the subtraction of the term $2014^3$. This will leave us with just $2013^3$ and $1$. We can substitute the values back into the numerator to verify this: \\begin{align*}\n(2013 - 2014)^3 &=2013^3 - 3 \\cdot 2013^2 \\cdot 2014 + 3 \\cdot 2013 \\cdot 2014^2 -  2014^3\\\\\n&=2013^3 - 3 \\cdot 2013^2 \\cdot 2014 + 3 \\cdot 2013 \\cdot 2014^2 -  2014^3 + (2014^3 - 2013^3)\\\\\n&=2013^3 - 2 \\cdot 2013^2 \\cdot 2014 + 3 \\cdot 2013 \\cdot 2014^2 -  2014^3 +1.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the value of the fraction is simply $\\boxed{2013^2 - 1}$.",
