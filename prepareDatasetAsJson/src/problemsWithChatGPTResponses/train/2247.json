    "problem": "The cost of five pencils and one pen is $\\$2.50$, and the cost of one pencil and two pens is $\\$1.85$. What is the cost of two pencils and one pen?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the cost of one pencil be $a$ and the cost of one pen be $b$. We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information. The equations are:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n5a + b &= 2.5 \\\\\na + 2b &= 1.85 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe are trying to find the value of $2a + b$. Notice that when we add the two equations, we get $6a+3b=4.35$. This is just three times what we are looking for, so dividing both sides of this last equation by three, we get that $2a+b=1.45$. Thus, the cost of two pencils and one pen is $\\boxed{1.45}$ dollars.\n\nAlternatively, we could solve our system of equations for $a$ and $b$ and then find the value of $2a+b$. In this case, we get that $a=.35$ and $b=.75$, so $2a+b=1.45$, as expected.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We set up a system of equations to represent the given information. Denote the cost of a pencil as $p$ and the cost of a pen as $q$. The first piece of information tells us that \\begin{align*}\n5p+q&=2.50\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n10p+2q&=\\boxed{5.00}.\n\\end{align*} The second piece of information tells us that \\begin{align*}\np+2q&=1.85\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n2p+4q&=3.70.\n\\end{align*} We can solve these equations to find $p$ and $q$, but we can observe that the first equation is simply twice the second. Thus, since $2p+4q=3.70$, we see that $10p+20q=18.50$, which is equal to $5\\cdot 2.50$. So $(5+2q)=10$ and $2q=5$ and $q=\\frac{5}{2}$. Substituting, we find $p=2(1.85)-2\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)=3.70-5=-1.30$. Thus two pencils and one pen cost $2p+q=2(-1.30)+\\frac{5}{2}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{5}}$."
