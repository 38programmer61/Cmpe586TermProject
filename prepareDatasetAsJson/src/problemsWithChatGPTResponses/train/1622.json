    "problem": "The force needed to loosen a bolt varies inversely with the length of the handle of the wrench used. A wrench with a handle length of 9 inches requires 375 pounds of force to loosen a certain bolt. A wrench of 15 inches will require how many pounds of force to loosen the same bolt?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "When we change from a 9-inch wrench to a 15-inch wrench, we multiply the length of the wrench by $\\frac{15}{9} = \\frac{5}{3}$.  Since the wrench length and the force required are inversely proportional, their product must be constant.  So, when we multiply the wrench length by $\\dfrac53$, we must multiply the force required by $\\dfrac35$ in order to keep their product constant.  So, the force required is $(375)\\left(\\frac35\\right) = \\boxed{225}$ pounds of force.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We can use the inverse variation formula: \n\nforce = k/length \n\nwhere k is the constant of variation. \n\nPlugging in the values given, we have:\n\n375 = k/9 \n\nTo find k, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 9:\n\n375 * 9 = k \n\nk = 3375 \n\nNow, we can use the value of k to find the force required with a wrench handle length of 15 inches:\n\nforce = 3375/15 \n\nforce = 225 pounds \n\nTherefore, a wrench with a handle length of 15 inches will require 225 pounds of force to loosen the same bolt."
