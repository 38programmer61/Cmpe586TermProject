                "content": "Since $\\frac{-21-\\sqrt{301}}{10}$ is a root of $5x^2+21x+v$, the polynomial can be written as $(x-\\frac{-21-\\sqrt{301}}{10})(Ax-r)$. Expanding this gives $\\frac{10}{5} (x+\\frac{21+\\sqrt{301}}{10})(Ax-r)=2(x+\\frac{21+\\sqrt{301}}{10})(Ax-r)$, where $r$ is a constant we still need to find and $A$ is also a constant we need to find.\n\nExpanding the right hand side of $2(x+\\frac{21+\\sqrt{301}}{10})(Ax-r)$ gives us  $2Ax^2 + 2Ax(-r)+ 2x(\\frac{21+\\sqrt{301}}{10})(-r)+(\\frac{21+\\sqrt{301}}{10}) (-r)$. \n\nTherefore we have 2 equations:\n\n\\[21A+2r=21, (\\dagger)\\]\n\\[(\\frac{21+\\sqrt{301}}{10})r= v. (\\ddagger)\\]\n\nWe want the term with $x$ to drop out of our quadratic, so we let $2Ar=0$ since there is no $x$ term on the left hand side. This gives us $A=0$ or $r=0$. Since we know that $A\\neq 0$ (the $Ax$ term does not disappear in $5x^2+21x+v$), we must have $r=0.$ From $(\\dagger)$ we then get $21A = 21,$ so $A=1.$ From $(\\ddagger)$, we know that $(\\frac{21+\\sqrt{301}}{10})r=v$. Since $r=0,$ we must have $v= \\boxed{0}$.",
