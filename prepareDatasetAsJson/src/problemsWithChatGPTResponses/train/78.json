    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Rewrite $2^{3x}$ as $(2^3)^x=8^x$.  Multiply both sides of $8^x=7$ by 8 to find that $8^{x+1}=7\\cdot 8=\\boxed{56}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Taking the square root of both sides of the given equation, we have $\\sqrt{2^{3x}}=\\sqrt{7}$. The square root of $2^{3x}$ is equal to $2^{3x/2}$. Therefore, $2^{3x/2}=\\sqrt{7}$. Since $8=2^3$, we can substitute this expression in to yield $2^{3x/2}=\\sqrt{7}=(2^{3x/2})^3$. Taking the cube root of both sides, we have $2^{3x/2}=\\sqrt[3]{(\\sqrt{7})^3}$. Simplifying the right side, we have $2^{3x/2}=\\sqrt[3]{343}$. Applying the property $\\sqrt[3]{x^a}=x^{a/3}$ for $x\\ge 0$, we can write $\\sqrt[3]{343}=343^{1/3}$. Rewriting $343$ as $7^3$, we have $343^{1/3}=(7^3)^{1/3}$. Using the property $(x^a)^b=x^{ab}$, this simplifies to $343^{1/3}=7^{3(1/3)}$. Since $3(1/3)=1$, we can rewrite this as $343^{1/3}=7^1=7$. Therefore, we have $$2^{3x/2}=\\sqrt[3]{343}=7.$$Cubing both sides, we have $(2^{3x/2})^3=7^3$, so $2^{3x/2}=343$. Since $8=2^3$, we can substitute $343$ in on the right side: $2^{3x/2} = 8^x$. We have now reduced the problem to solving $8^x=7$. Taking the logarithm of both sides, we have $\\log_8{\\left(8^x\\right)}=\\log_8{7}$. Since $\\log_a{(a^b)}=b$ for all $a>0$ and $a\\neq1$, we can write this as $\\log_8{\\left(8^x\\right)}=x$. Therefore, $\\log_8{7}=x$, so $8^{x+1}=8^x\\cdot 8=7\\cdot 8=\\boxed{56}$."
