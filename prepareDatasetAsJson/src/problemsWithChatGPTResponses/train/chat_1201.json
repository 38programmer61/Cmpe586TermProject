                "content": "If the ratio of $b$ to $a$ is $3$, then we can write $\\frac{b}{a}=3$.  Multiplying both sides by $a$ yields $b=3a$.  Plugging this expression for $b$ into the equation $b=12-5a$, we get $3a=12-5a$.  Adding $5a$ to both sides and subtracting $3a$ from both sides, we have $8a=12$.  Dividing both sides by $8$, we obtain $a=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.",
