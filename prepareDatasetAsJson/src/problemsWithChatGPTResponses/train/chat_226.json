                "content": "For the first equation, we can add $19$ to both sides to obtain $y+19 = 4x$. Rearranging the terms gives $4x = y+19$.\n\nFor the second equation, subtracting $2x$ from both sides gives $y = -2x + 95$.\n\nSetting the expressions for $4x$ equal to $y$ gives us $y+19 = -2x+95$.\n\nSimplifying the equation gives $y = -2x+76.$\n\nSince the $y$ expressions on both sides are equal, the $-2x+76$ must equal $-2x+95$. Thus $76$ equals $95$, which is impossible. We conclude that the two lines are parallel, so they do not intersect. $\\boxed{\\text{No such value}}$ of $x$ exists.",
