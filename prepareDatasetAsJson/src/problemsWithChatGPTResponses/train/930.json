    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First we get all the terms with $y$ on one side by subtracting $1.7y$ from both sides.  This gives us $4+0.6y = -20$.  Subtracting 4 from both sides gives $0.6y = -24$.  Dividing both sides by 0.6 isolates $y$ and gives us $y = -24/(0.6) = -240/6 = \\boxed{-40}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Starting with the given equation, $4+2.3y = 1.7y - 20$, we can isolate the variable $y$ by subtracting $1.7y$ from both sides: \\begin{align*}\n4+2.3y &= 1.7y - 20 \\\\\n4+0.6y &= -20 \\\\\n0.6y &= -24 \\\\\ny &= \\frac{-24}{0.6} \\\\\ny &= \\boxed{-40}.\n\\end{align*}"
