                "content": "For simplicity, let's call the three consecutive positive integers $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$. Then, the sum of their squares is \n\\[(n-1)^2 + n^2 + (n+1)^2 = 7805.\\] Expanding, we have $n^2 - 2n + 1 + n^2 + n^2 + 2n + 1 = 7805$, which simplifies to $3n^2 + 2 = 7805$. Simplifying further, we have $3n^2 = 7803$, so $n^2 = 2601$. Hence, $n = 51$, and the three integers are $50, 51,$ and $52$. The sum of their cubes is $50^3 + 51^3 + 52^3 = \\boxed{398259}$.",
