    "problem": "On a hot day, Megan likes to eat a Popsicle every 15 minutes. Assuming she keeps up that rate of consumption, how many Popsicles can Megan finish in 4 hours and 30 minutes?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $p$ be the number of Popsicles Megan can finish in 4 hours and 30 minutes. If we convert that period of time into minutes, we find that 4 hours and 30 minutes is equal to $(4)(60)+30=270$ minutes. From here, we can set up the proportion  \\begin{align*} \\frac{x}{270}& =\\frac{1}{15}\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x& =\\left(\\frac{1}{15}\\right)(270)\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x& =\\boxed{18}\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours and 30 minutes is 4*60 + 30 = <<4*60+30=270>>270 minutes.\nSince Megan eats a Popsicle every 15 minutes, in 4 hours and 30 minutes, she can eat 270/15 = <<270/15=18>>18 Popsicles. Answer: \\boxed{18}."
