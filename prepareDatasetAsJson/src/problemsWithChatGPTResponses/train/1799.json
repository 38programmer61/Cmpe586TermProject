    "problem": "What is the value of $x$ for which $|3x+5|$ is not positive? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The only way $|3x+5|$ is not positive is if it is 0.  We have $|3x+5| = 0$ if and only if $3x+5 = 0$.  Solving this equation gives $x = \\boxed{-\\frac{5}{3}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "$|3x+5|$ is negative when $3x+5$ is negative, or $3x+5 < 0$, so $x < -\\frac{5}{3}$. $|3x+5|$ is zero when $3x+5 = 0$, so $x = -\\frac{5}{3}$. Since $|3x+5|$ is positive when $3x+5$ is positive, the value of $x$ when $|3x+5|$ is not positive is $\\boxed{-5/3}$."
