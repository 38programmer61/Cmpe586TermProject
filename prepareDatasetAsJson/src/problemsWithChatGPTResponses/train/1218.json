    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "This equation is solved by \\[h(x)=(3x^2-5x+3)-(9x^3-3x+1)=\\boxed{-9x^3+3x^2-2x+2}\\]",
    "chatgpt_solution": "First, we rewrite the given equation as \\[\\begin{aligned} (9x^3+0x^2-3x+1)+(h(x)-3x^2+5x-3) &= 0. \\end{aligned}\\]Every term must cancel, which forces $h(x) = \\boxed{-9x^3+3x^2+8x+2}$."
