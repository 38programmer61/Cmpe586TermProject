    "problem": "If $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ are the coordinates of two opposite vertices of a rectangle, what is the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the other two vertices?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The midpoints of the diagonals of a rectangle coincide, so the midpoint of the line segment joining $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ is also the midpoint of the line segment joining the other two vertices of the rectangle. The $y$-coordinate of a midpoint equals the average of the $y$-coordinates of the two endpoints. Therefore, the average of the $y$-coordinates of $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ equals the average of the $y$-coordinates of the missing vertices.  Since the sum is twice the average, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the missing vertices is the same as that of the given vertices: $17+(-4)=\\boxed{13}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We note that the diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with side lengths 6 and 21. So, the length of the diagonal is $\\sqrt{6^2 + 21^2} = \\sqrt{477}$.  Both diagonals of a rectangle have the same length, so we can translate one of the given points by the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\pm \\frac{21}{\\sqrt{477}} \\\\ \\pm \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{477}} \\end{pmatrix}$.  The sum of the $y$-coordinates of these points is $\\pm \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{477}} \\pm \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{477}} = \\pm \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{477}}$. Since $ \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{477}}$ is the square root of an integer times 6 (which is 6), both sums must be nonzero numbers with an absolute value less than 6, thus \"unable to determine\" unless more information is known.
