    "problem": "$3^n = 3 \\cdot 9^3 \\cdot 81^2$. What is the value of $n$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We want to write everything in terms of powers of 3. Doing so gives us $3^n = 3 \\cdot (3^2)^3 \\cdot (3^4)^2$. This simplifies to $3^n = 3 \\cdot 3^6 \\cdot 3^8$, so $3^n = 3^{15}$. Therefore, $n = \\boxed{15}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We begin by rewriting $3$ and $81$ as powers of $9$: $$3^n = 3 \\cdot 9^3 \\cdot 81^2 = 3 \\cdot (3^2)^3 \\cdot (3^4)^2.$$Applying the power-of-a-power rule and further simplifying, we have: $$3^n = 3 \\cdot 3^{2 \\cdot 3} \\cdot 3^{4 \\cdot 2} = 3^{1 + 6 + 8} = 3^{15}.$$Therefore, $n = \\boxed{15}$."
