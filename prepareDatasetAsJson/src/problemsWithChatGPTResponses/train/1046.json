    "problem": "The first and thirteenth terms of an arithmetic sequence are 5 and 29, respectively. What is the fiftieth term?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $d$ be the common difference in this arithmetic sequence.  Then the $13^{\\text{th}}$ term is $5 + 12d = 29$.  Solving for $d$, we find $d = 2$.  Then the $50^{\\text{th}}$ term is $5 + 49 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{103}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let $d$ be the common difference, and let $a_1$ be the first term.  Since the common difference between consecutive terms is $d$, the $13^{\\text{th}}$ term is $a_1 + 12d$.  Setting this equal to $29$, we have  \\[a_1 + 12d = 29.\\]Since $a_1 = 5$, we have $5 + 12d = 29$, so $12d = 24$ and $d = 2$.  Therefore, the $50^{\\text{th}}$ term is $a_1 + 49d = 5 + 49 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{103}$."
