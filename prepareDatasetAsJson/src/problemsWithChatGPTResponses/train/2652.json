    "problem": "For what real value of $v$ is $\\frac{-21-\\sqrt{301}}{10}$ a root of $5x^2+21x+v$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We could substitute $(-21-\\sqrt{301})/10$ for $x$ in the equation, but the quadratic formula suggests a quicker approach. Substituting $5$, $21$, and $v$ into the quadratic formula gives  \\[\n\\frac{-(21)\\pm\\sqrt{(21)^2-4(5)(v)}}{2(5)}= \\frac{-21\\pm\\sqrt{441-20v}}{10}.\n\\]Setting $(-21+\\sqrt{441-20v})/10$ and $(-21-\\sqrt{441-20v})/10$ equal to $(-21-\\sqrt{301})/10$, we find no solution in the first case and $441-20v=301$ in the second case.  Solving yields $v=(301-441)/(-20)=(-140)/(-20)=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since $\\frac{-21-\\sqrt{301}}{10}$ is a root of $5x^2+21x+v$, the polynomial can be written as $(x-\\frac{-21-\\sqrt{301}}{10})(Ax-r)$. Expanding this gives $\\frac{10}{5} (x+\\frac{21+\\sqrt{301}}{10})(Ax-r)=2(x+\\frac{21+\\sqrt{301}}{10})(Ax-r)$, where $r$ is a constant we still need to find and $A$ is also a constant we need to find.\n\nExpanding the right hand side of $2(x+\\frac{21+\\sqrt{301}}{10})(Ax-r)$ gives us  $2Ax^2 + 2Ax(-r)+ 2x(\\frac{21+\\sqrt{301}}{10})(-r)+(\\frac{21+\\sqrt{301}}{10}) (-r)$. \n\nTherefore we have 2 equations:\n\n\\[21A+2r=21, (\\dagger)\\]\n\\[(\\frac{21+\\sqrt{301}}{10})r= v. (\\ddagger)\\]\n\nWe want the term with $x$ to drop out of our quadratic, so we let $2Ar=0$ since there is no $x$ term on the left hand side. This gives us $A=0$ or $r=0$. Since we know that $A\\neq 0$ (the $Ax$ term does not disappear in $5x^2+21x+v$), we must have $r=0.$ From $(\\dagger)$ we then get $21A = 21,$ so $A=1.$ From $(\\ddagger)$, we know that $(\\frac{21+\\sqrt{301}}{10})r=v$. Since $r=0,$ we must have $v= \\boxed{0}$."
