    "solution": "If $4x^2 + 14x + a$  is the square of a binomial, then the binomial has the form $2x +b$ for some number $b$, because $(2x)^2 = 4x^2$.  So, we compare $(2x+b)^2$ to $4x^2 + 14x + a$. Expanding $(2x+b)^2$ gives \\[(2x+b)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2(2x)(b) + b^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2.\\] Equating the linear term of this to the linear term of $4x^2+14x+a$, we have $4bx=14x$, so $b=\\frac{14}{4}=\\frac{7}{2}$. Squaring the binomial gives $\\left(2x+\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2=4x^2+14x+\\frac{49}{4}$. Therefore, $a=\\boxed{\\frac{49}{4}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We look for a binomial of the form $2x + b$. Since we want $(2x+b)^2$ to equal $4x^2 + 14x + a$, we can use the method of expanding $(2x+b)^2$ to find $b$. Expanding, we have $$(2x+b)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2(2x)(b) + b^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2.$$Comparing this with $4x^2 + 14x + a$, we see that the middle term matches when $4bx = 14x$, which has a solution $b = \\frac{14}{4}=\\frac72$. This gives us $$4x^2 + 14x + a = 4x^2 + 4\\cdot\\frac72 x + \\left(\\frac72\\right)^2,$$which tells us $a = \\left(\\frac72\\right)^2=\\boxed{\\frac{49}{4}}$."
