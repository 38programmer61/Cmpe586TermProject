    "problem": "Find all solutions to the equation $\\displaystyle\\sqrt[3]{3 - x} = -\\frac{3}{2}$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We get rid of the cube root sign by cubing both sides.  This gives us $3-x = -\\frac{27}{8}$.  Solving this equation gives $x = 3 + \\frac{27}{8} = \\boxed{\\frac{51}{8}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Cubing both sides of the equation $\\displaystyle \\sqrt[3]{3-x }=-\\frac{3}{2}$, we find $\\displaystyle 3-x=-\\frac{27}{8}$.  Solving this equation for $x$ gives $\\displaystyle x = \\frac{51}{8}$.  Checking, we see that this is a valid solution.  Thus, the equation $\\displaystyle \\sqrt[3]{3-x }=-\\frac{3}{2}$ has just one solution, $\\displaystyle x = \\frac{51}{8}$."
