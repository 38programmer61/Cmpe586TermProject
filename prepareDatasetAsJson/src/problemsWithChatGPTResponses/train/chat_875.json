                "content": "The distance between $A$ and $B$ is $\\sqrt{3250^2-3000^2}=700$ km. Therefore, the cost to fly from $A$ to $B$ is $100+0.10(700)=\\boxed{170}$. Alternatively, we could observe that the airplane fare is $\\$0.10$ per km, so the cost is $0.10(3250)=\\$325$, but since Piravena is partway through the trip, she has already paid $0.10(3000)=\\$300$, so she still owes $\\$325-\\$300=\\$25$ in airplane tickets. However, since the cost to go by bus would be $\\$0.15(3250)=\\$487.50$, she chooses to fly, and the cost is only $\\$100+\\$25=\\boxed{\\$125}$.",
