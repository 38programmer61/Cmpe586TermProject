    "problem": "On Monday, I worked $t-6$ hours and earned $2t-5$ dollars per hour. My friend Andrew worked $2t-8$ hours but only earned $t-5$ dollars an hour. As it turns out, we earned the same amount. What is the value of $t$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since we both earned the same amount, \\begin{align*}\n(t-6) (2t-5) &= (2t-8)(t-5) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 2t^2-17t+30 &= 2t^2 - 18t+ 40.\n\\end{align*}Simplifying gives $t = \\boxed{10}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Andrew earned $(2t-8)(t-5)$ dollars and you earned $(t-6)(2t-5)$ dollars. Both these dollar amounts are equal to $2t^2-18t+40$. Thus, we have \\begin{align*}\n(t-6)(2t-5)&=(2t-8)(t-5)\\\\\nt(2t-5)-(6)(2t-5)&=2t(t-4)-(8)(t-4)\\\\\n2t^2-5t-12t+30&=2t^2-8t-4t+32\\\\\n2t^2-17t+30&=2t^2-12t+32\\\\\n-17t+30&=-12t+32\\\\\n-17t+12t&=32-30\\\\\n-5t&=2.\n\\end{align*} Dividing $-5t=2$ by $-5$ will give us the solution $t=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{5}}.$"
