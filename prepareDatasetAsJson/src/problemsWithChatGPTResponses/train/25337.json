    "problem": "At Rosa's Rose Shop, a bouquet containing a dozen roses costs $\\$20$. If the price of a bouquet is directly proportional to the number of roses it contains, how many dollars will a bouquet of 39 roses cost?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $c$ equal the cost of a bouquet of 39 roses (in dollars). Since we know that the price of a bouquet is directly proportional to the number of roses it contains, we can set up the following proportion \\begin{align*} \\frac{c}{39}&=\\frac{20}{12}\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad c&=\\left(\\frac{20}{12}\\right)(39)\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad c&=\\boxed{65}\n\\end{align*}",
    "chatgpt_solution": "The shop sells a bouquet of ten roses for $20$, so each rose in the dozen costs $20/12=\\$1.67.$ Therefore, a bouquet of 39 roses will cost $39 \\cdot \\$1.67 = \\$\\boxed{65.13}.$"
