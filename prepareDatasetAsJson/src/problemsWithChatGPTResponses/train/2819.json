    "problem": "The positive number $a$ is chosen such that the terms $20, a, \\frac{5}{4}$ are the first, second and third terms, respectively, of a geometric sequence. What is the value of $a$, if $a$ is positive?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the common ratio of the geometric sequence be $r$. We have the equations $20\\cdot r = a$ and $a \\cdot r = \\frac{5}{4}$. In the first equation, we solve for $r$ to get $r=\\frac{a}{20}$, and substitute this into the second equation to eliminate $r$, resulting in $a \\cdot \\frac{a}{20} = \\frac{5}{4}$, or $a = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Since $20$ is the first term, and $\\tfrac54$ is the third, then the second term $a$ satisfies \\[\\frac{5}{4} \\div a = a \\div 20\\] Cross multiplying gives $a^2 = \\frac{5}{4} \\cdot 20 = 5 \\cdot 5 = 25$, so $a = \\sqrt{25} = \\boxed{5}$."
