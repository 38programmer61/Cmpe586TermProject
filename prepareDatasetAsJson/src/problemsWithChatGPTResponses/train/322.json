    "problem": "Fully factor the following expression: $2x^2-8$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can factor out a $2$ from both terms, giving $(2)(x^2-4)$. Then we can factor the second expression because it is a difference of squares, giving $\\boxed{(2) (x+2) (x-2)}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We can factor out a $2$ to get $2(x^2-4)$. Next, we can notice that $x^2-4$ is of the form $a^2-b^2$, which factors into $(a+b)(a-b)$. Setting $a = x$ and $b=2$, we get $(x+2)(x-2)$. Thus, we have the fully factored expression as $\\boxed{2(x+2)(x-2)}$."
