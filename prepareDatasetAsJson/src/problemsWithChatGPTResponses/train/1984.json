    "problem": "A gasoline tank is $\\frac78$ full. After $12$ gallons have been used, it is half full. How many gallons does this tank hold when it is full?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ represent the number of gallons the tank holds when it is full. We know that the difference between $\\frac78$ full and $\\frac12$ full is 12 gallons, so we set up an equation and solve for $x$. \\begin{align*}\n12&=\\frac78x-\\frac12x\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n12&=\\frac38x\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n12\\cdot\\frac83&=x\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n32&=x\n\\end{align*} The tank holds $\\boxed{32}$ gallons when it is full.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let $x$ be the number of gallons that the tank holds when it is full. Since the tank is $\\frac78$ full, $(\\frac78)(x) = \\frac{7}{8}x$ gallons of gasoline are in the tank. After $\\frac78x - 12 = \\frac{7}{8}x - 12$ gallons have been used, the tank is half full, or $\\frac{1}{2}(x)$ gallons. So \\[\\begin{array}{r@{\\;}c@{\\;}c@{\\;}c}\n\\frac{7}{8}x - 12 &=& \\frac{1}{2}x. \\\\\n(2)\\left(\\frac{7}{8}x - 12\\right) &=& (2)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right). \\\\\n\\frac{14}{8}x - 24 &=& x. \\\\\n\\frac{14}{8}x - x &=& 24. \\\\\n\\frac86x - \\frac86x &=& 24. \\\\\n\\frac26x &=& 24. \\\\\nx &=& \\boxed{72} \\text{ gallons}.\n\\end{array}\\]"
