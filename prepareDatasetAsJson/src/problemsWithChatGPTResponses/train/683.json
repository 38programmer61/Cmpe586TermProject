    "problem": "If $\\sqrt{2\\sqrt{t-2}} = \\sqrt[4]{7 - t}$, then find $t$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We raise both sides to the fourth power, which is equivalent to squaring twice, in order to get rid of the radicals. The left-hand side becomes $$\\left(\\sqrt{2\\sqrt{t-2}}\\right)^4 = \\left(2\\sqrt{t-2}\\right)^2 = 4 \\cdot (t-2) = 4t-8.$$The right-hand side becomes $\\left(\\sqrt[4]{7-t}\\right)^4 = 7-t$. Setting them equal, $$4t-8 = 7-t \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad 5t = 15,$$and $t = \\boxed{3}$.  Checking, we find that this value does indeed satisfy the original equation.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "If $\\sqrt{2\\sqrt{t-2}} = \\sqrt [4]{7 - t}$, then we square both sides of the equation to get $2\\sqrt{t-2} = \\sqrt{7-t}$. Next, we square both sides again to get $4(t-2) = 7 - t$. Therefore, $4t - 8 = 7 - t$, and $5t=15$. Therefore, $t = \\boxed{3}$."
