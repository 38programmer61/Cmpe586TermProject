                "content": "We could use the distance formula to find the distance between the two points, but we can also find the distance without the distance formula. Drawing a right triangle with horizontal and vertical legs, we see that the horizontal leg has length $7-(-5)=12$ and the vertical leg has length $3-(-2)=5$. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem, we find the length of the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{12^2+5^2}=\\sqrt{144+25}=\\sqrt{169}=\\boxed{13}$.",
