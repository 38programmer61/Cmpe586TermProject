    "problem": "Find the slope of the line that is perpendicular to the line $2x + 3y = 6$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The given line has slope $-\\frac{2}{3}$, so the line perpendicular to this line has slope $-\\frac{1}{-2/3} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We can rewrite the given line as $y = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 2$.  Therefore, the line $2x + 3y = 6$ has slope $-\\frac{2}{3}$.  The slope of a line that is perpendicular to this line is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$."
