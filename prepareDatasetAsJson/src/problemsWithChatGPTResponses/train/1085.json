    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We consider two cases, $y\\ge 6$ and $y < 6$.\n\nCase 1: $y \\ge 6:$  If $y \\ge 6$, then $|y-6| = y-6$ and our equation is $y-6+2y=9$.  So, we have $3y = 15$, or $y=5$. However, $y=5$ does not satisfy $y\\ge 6$.  Testing $y=5$, we have $|5-6| + 2\\cdot 5 =11$, not 9, and we see that $y=5$ is not a solution.\n\nCase 2: $y < 6:$   If $y<6$, then $|y-6| = -(y-6) = -y+6$, so our equation is $-y+6+2y = 9$, from which we have $y=\\boxed{3}$. This is a valid solution, since $y=3$ satisfies the restriction $y<6$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We have two cases to consider, $y-6 \\ge 0$ and $y-6<0$.\n\nCase 1: $y-6\\ge 0$\n\nIf $y-6\\ge 0$, then $|y-6|=y-6$, so we substitute that into the equation: $y-6+2y = 9$. Combining like terms gives $3y-6=9$, and adding 6 to both sides gives $3y=15$. Dividing by 3, we have $y=\\boxed{5}$.\n\nCase 2: $y-6<0$\n\nIf $y-6< 0$, then $|y-6|=-(y-6)$. In this case, we substitute that into the equation: $-(y-6)+2y = 9$. Expanding the left side gives $-y+6+2y=9$, and combining like terms gives $y+6=9$. Subtracting 6 from both sides gives $y=3$.\n\nChecking the solutions, we see that in Case 2, $|3 - 6| + 2(3) = 6 + 6 \\neq 9$, so $y=3$ is not a solution.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is $y=\\boxed{5}$."
