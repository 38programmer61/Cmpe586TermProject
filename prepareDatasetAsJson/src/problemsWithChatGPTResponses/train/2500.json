    "problem": "The value of $\\log_{10}{28471}$ is between the consecutive integers $a$ and $b$.  Find $a+b$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can have $\\log_{10}10000=4$ and $\\log_{10}100000=5$.  Since $\\log_{10}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\\log_{10}10000<\\log_{10}28471<\\log_{10}100000$, meaning $4<\\log_{10}28471<5$.  Thus, the desired sum is $4+5=\\boxed{9}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "$100^2=10000<28471<1000^2=1000000$, so $\\log_{10}100=2<\\log_{10}{28471}<\\log_{10}1000=3$. Increasing $a$ by 2 and $b$ by 2 will not change the condition $\\log_{10}{28471}$ is between $a$ and $b$, so we can write $a = 4$ and $b=5$.  Thus $a + b = 4 + 5 = \\boxed{9}$."
