    "problem": "The difference between two positive integers is 12 and their product is 45. What is the sum of the integers?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the integers be $x$ and $y$ with $x>y$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\nx-y&=12\\\\\nxy&=45\n\\end{align*}Squaring the first equation, we get  \\[(x-y)^2=12^2\\Rightarrow x^2-2xy+y^2=144\\]Multiplying the second equation by four, we get $4xy = 4\\cdot45=180$. Adding these last two equations, we have \\[x^2-2xy+y^2+4xy=144+180 \\Rightarrow (x+y)^2=324 \\Rightarrow x+y = 18\\]In the last step, we take the positive square root because both $x$ and $y$ are given to be positive. The sum of the two integers is $\\boxed{18}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let's call the two positive integers x and y. We are given that the difference between the two integers is 12, so we can write the equation x - y = 12.\n\nWe are also given that the product of the two integers is 45, so we can write the equation xy = 45.\n\nWe can solve these two equations by substitution. Solving the first equation for x, we find that x = y + 12. We can substitute this expression for x in the second equation: (y + 12)y = 45.\n\nExpanding the expression, we get y^2 + 12y = 45.\n\nRearranging the terms and subtracting 45 from both sides, we get y^2 + 12y - 45 = 0.\n\nFactoring this quadratic equation, we find (y + 15)(y - 3) = 0.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we find y + 15 = 0 or y - 3 = 0.\n\nSolving for y, we find that y = -15 or y = 3.\n\nSince we are given that the integers are positive, we can ignore the solution y = -15.\n\nTherefore, y = 3, and substituting this value back into the equation x = y + 12, we find x = 3 + 12 = 15.\n\nThe sum of the two positive integers is x + y = 15 + 3 = 18.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the integers is 18. Answer: \\boxed{18}."
