                "content": "Since $D$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, we can use the midpoint formula to find its coordinates. The $x$-coordinate is the average of the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, so $D$ has an $x$-coordinate of $\\frac{0+0}{2}=0$. The $y$-coordinate is the average of the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, so $D$ has a $y$-coordinate of $\\frac{6+0}{2}=3$. Thus, $D$ has coordinates $(0,3)$.\n\nSince $C$ has an $x$-coordinate of $8$ and $D$ has an $x$-coordinate of $0$, and $C$ has a $y$-coordinate of $0$ and $D$ has a $y$-coordinate of $3$, we have two points on this line. We can use the slope formula (or simply compute the slope) to determine that the line passing through $C$ and $D$ has slope $\\dfrac{3-0}{0-8}=\\dfrac{3}{-8}=-\\dfrac{3}{8}$. We can also use the point-slope equation of a line to find the $y$-intercept. Since we know that the slope is $-\\frac{3}{8}$ and $(0,3)$ is a point on the line, we substitute these two values into the point-slope equation of a line: $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, where $(x_1,y_1)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope. We have $y-3=-\\frac{3}{8}(x-0)$, which simplifies to $y-3=-\\frac{3}{8}x$. Adding $3$ to both sides gives $y=-\\frac{3}{8}x+3$. Thus the line in the diagram passes through $\\left(0,3\\right)$ and has a slope of $-\\frac{3}{8}$. The desired quantity is the sum of the slope and $y$-intercept of $-\\frac{3}{8}$ and $3$, which is $(-\\frac{3}{8})+3=\\boxed{\\frac{21}{8}}$.",
