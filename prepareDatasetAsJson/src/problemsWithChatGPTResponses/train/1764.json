    "problem": "The area of the floor in a square room is 225 square feet. The homeowners plan to cover the floor with rows of 6-inch by 6-inch tiles. How many tiles will be in each row?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The length of each side of the room is $\\sqrt{225}=15$ feet, or $15\\cdot12=180$ inches. Since each tile has a length of 6 inches, each row needs $180/6=\\boxed{30}$ tiles.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "First, we need to convert the area of the room from square feet to square inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so there are 12*12=<<12*12=144>>144 square inches in 1 square foot.\nTherefore, the area of the room in square inches is 225*144=<<225*144=32400>>32,400 square inches.\nSince each tile is 6 inches by 6 inches, the area of each tile is 6*6=<<6*6=36>>36 square inches.\nThus, the number of tiles in each row is 32,400/36=<<32400/36=900>>900. Answer: \\boxed{900}."
