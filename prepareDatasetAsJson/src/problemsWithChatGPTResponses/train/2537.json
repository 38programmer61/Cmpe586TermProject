    "problem": "If $5a+2b=0$ and $a$ is two less than $b$, what is $7b$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First we begin by solving the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n5a+2b&=0, \\\\\nb-2&=a.\n\\end{align*}Making the substitution for $a$ from the second equation to the first, we get $5(b-2)+2b=0$, which simplifies to $7b-10=0$. Solving for $b$, we find that $b=\\frac{10}{7}$. Hence $7b=7\\cdot \\frac{10}{7}=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "If $a$ is two less than $b$, then we can write $a=b-2$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $5(b-2)+2b=0$. Expanding the equation, we find $5b-10+2b=0$. Combining like terms, we have $7b-10=0$. Adding $10$ to both sides gives $7b=10$. Thus $7b=\\boxed{10}$."
