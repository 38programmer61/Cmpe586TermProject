                "content": "We set up a system of equations to represent the given information. Denote the cost of a pencil as $p$ and the cost of a pen as $q$. The first piece of information tells us that \\begin{align*}\n5p+q&=2.50\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n10p+2q&=\\boxed{5.00}.\n\\end{align*} The second piece of information tells us that \\begin{align*}\np+2q&=1.85\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n2p+4q&=3.70.\n\\end{align*} We can solve these equations to find $p$ and $q$, but we can observe that the first equation is simply twice the second. Thus, since $2p+4q=3.70$, we see that $10p+20q=18.50$, which is equal to $5\\cdot 2.50$. So $(5+2q)=10$ and $2q=5$ and $q=\\frac{5}{2}$. Substituting, we find $p=2(1.85)-2\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)=3.70-5=-1.30$. Thus two pencils and one pen cost $2p+q=2(-1.30)+\\frac{5}{2}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{5}}$.",
