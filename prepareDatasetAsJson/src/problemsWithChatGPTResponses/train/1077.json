    "problem": "The sum of two numbers is $45$. Their difference is $3$. What is the lesser of the two numbers?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x,y$ be the larger and smaller numbers, respectively. We have $x+y=45$ and $x-y=3$. Thus: $y=\\frac{1}{2}((x+y)-(x-y))=\\frac{1}{2}(45-3)=\\boxed{21}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$. We have the system of equations \\begin{align*}\nx+y&=45, \\\\\nx-y&=3.\n\\end{align*} Adding the two equations yields $2x=48$ and $x=\\boxed{24}$."
