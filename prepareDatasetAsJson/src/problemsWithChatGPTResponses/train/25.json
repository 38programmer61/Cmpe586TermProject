    "problem": "If $4^6=8^n$, what is $n$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We begin by expressing both sides of the equation in terms of the base 2: $(2^2)^6=(2^3)^n$, which simplifies to $2^{12}=2^{3n}$. Setting the exponents equal to each other, $12=3n$, or $n=\\frac{12}{3}=\\boxed{4}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Rewriting $4^6$ as $(2^2)^6 = 2^{2\\cdot 6} = 2^{12}$ and $8^n$ as $2^{3n}$, we see that $2^{12}=2^{3n}$. Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides gives $12=3n$. Solving for $n$ we have $n = \\boxed{4}$."
