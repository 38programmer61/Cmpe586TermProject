                "content": "The formula to find the number of diagonals in a regular polygon is given by:\n\nd = n(n-3)/2\n\nWhere d is the number of diagonals and n is the number of sides.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n9 = n(n-3)/2\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\nn(n-3) = 18\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\nn^2 - 3n = 18\n\nNow, subtracting 18 from both sides:\n\nn^2 - 3n - 18 = 0\n\nFactoring the equation, we get:\n\n(n-6)(n+3) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we have two possible solutions:\n\nn - 6 = 0 or n + 3 = 0\n\nSolving each equation, we find:\n\nn = 6 or n = -3\n\nSince a polygon cannot have a negative number of sides, the only valid solution is n = 6.\n\nTherefore, the regular polygon has 6 sides.",
