    "problem": "Compute $i^{600} + i^{599} + \\cdots + i + 1$, where $i^2=-1$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Each group of 4 consecutive powers of $i$ adds to 0: $i + i^2 + i^3 + i^4 = i - 1 - i +1 = 0$, $i^5+i^6+i^7+i^8 = i^4(i+i^2+i^3+i^4) = 1(0) = 0$, and so on.  Because 600 is divisible by 4, we know that if we start grouping the powers of $i$ as suggested by our first two groups above, we won't have any `extra' powers of $i$ beyond $i^{600}$.  We will, however, have the extra 1 before the $i$, so: \\[i^{600} + i^{599} + \\cdots + i + 1 = (0) + (0) + \\cdots + (0) + 1 = \\boxed{1}.\\]",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Notice that $(i)(i^2) = i(-1) = -i = i^3$. Since exponentiation is distributive, we see that $i^{600} + i^{599} + \\cdots + i^3$ and $i^{600} + i^{599} + \\cdots + i^3 + i^2$ must be equal. Hence, our answer is equal to the sum of a finite geometric sequence with the common ratio $i$ and first term $i = i^1$. The sum of a finite geometric series is equal to\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{i^2 - i^{601}}{1-i} &= \\frac{(-1) - (i)(-1)}{(1)(-1)-i} \\\\\n&= \\frac{-1 + i}{1+i} \\\\\n&= \\frac{i-1}{i+1} \\cdot \\frac{i}{i} = \\boxed{-\\frac{1+i}{2}}.\n\\end{align*}"
