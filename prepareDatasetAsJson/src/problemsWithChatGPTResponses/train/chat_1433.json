                "content": "To maximize the area of a rectangular pen given a fixed perimeter, we should aim for a square, as a square will have the largest possible area for a given amount of fencing.\n\nLet's assume the side length of the square is x. Since a square has four equal sides, the perimeter of the square is 4x.\n\nWe are given that the perimeter is 40 feet, so we can set up the equation:\n\n4x = 40\n\nSimplifying, we find:\n\nx = 10\n\nTherefore, the side length of the square is 10 feet.\n\nTo find the area, we square the side length:\n\nArea = (10)^2 = 100 square feet\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible area of a rectangular pen enclosed by 40 feet of fencing is 100 square feet.",
