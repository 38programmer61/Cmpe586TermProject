    "problem": "When the square root of $x$ is cubed, the answer is 64. What is the value of $x$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have $(\\sqrt{x})^3=64$ and solve for $x$. $$x^\\frac{3}{2}=64\\qquad\\Rightarrow x=64^\\frac{2}{3}=(64^\\frac{1}{3})^2=4^2=16$$The value of $x$ is $\\boxed{16}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "When the square root of $x$ is cubed, the answer is $64$. Writing this as an equation, we have $\\sqrt{x^3}=64$. To undo the cube, we cube root both sides of the equation to get $x=64^{1/3}=\\boxed{4}$."
