                "content": "Let the first term be $a$, and let the common difference be $d$. Then our arithmetic sequence is $a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, \\dots$ The second term of the sequence is $a + d$, and the fifth term is $a + 4d$. We are given that $a + d = 17$ and $a + 4d = 19$. We want to find $a + 7d$, which is the eighth term of the sequence. Note that $a + 4d - (a+d) = 3d = 19 - 17 = 2$, so $d = \\dfrac{2}{3}$. Then $a + 7d = a + \\dfrac{14}{3} = \\dfrac{3a}{3} + \\dfrac{14}{3} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}$.",
