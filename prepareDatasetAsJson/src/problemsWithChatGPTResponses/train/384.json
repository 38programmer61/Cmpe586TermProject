    "problem": "Sarah is trying to fence a rectangular area containing at least 100 sq. ft while using the least amount of material to build the fence. The length of the rectangular area should be 15 ft longer than the width. What should the width, in ft, be?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can write the problem as the inequality $w(w+15)\\ge100$. Distributing on the left-hand side, subtracting 100 from both sides, and factoring, we get \\begin{align*}\nw(w+15)&\\ge100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\nw^2+15w-100&\\ge 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n(w-5)(w+20)&\\ge 0.\n\\end{align*} The roots are $w=5$ and $w=-20$. We can't have a width of -20 ft, so the smallest width possible while still having an area of at least 100 sq. ft is $\\boxed{5}$ ft.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let the width be x ft.\n\nSo, the length would be x + 15 ft.\n\nThe area of the rectangular area would be length \u00d7 width = (x + 15) \u00d7 x = x^2 + 15x sq. ft.\n\nGiven that the area should be at least 100 sq. ft, we have x^2 + 15x \u2265 100.\n\nTo find the values of x that satisfy this inequality, we can rearrange it to x^2 + 15x - 100 \u2265 0.\n\nNow, we can factorize the quadratic expression: (x + 20)(x - 5) \u2265 0.\n\nTo determine the values of x that satisfy this inequality, we can create a sign chart:\n```\n+------------------------+\n|           (+)          |\n|       . . . . .        |\n|   . . . . . . . .      |\n|-\u221e+---------+---------+\u221e|\n|    (-)&nbsp;&nbsp;(&nbsp;+&nbsp;)   |\n+------------------------+\n```\nFrom the sign chart, we can see that the solution to the inequality is x \u2264 -20 or x \u2265 5.\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with a length, the width cannot be negative. Therefore, we take the value x = 5.\n\nTherefore, the width should be 5 ft."
