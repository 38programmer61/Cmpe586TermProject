                "content": "Let the two positive integers be $a$ and $b$, where $a > b$. Since their sum is $50$, we have $a + b = 50$, and since their difference is $12$, we have $a - b = 12$. Adding these equations gives $2a = 62$, so $a = 31$. Then the positive difference of their squares is $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b) = 50 \\cdot 12 = \\boxed{600}$.",
