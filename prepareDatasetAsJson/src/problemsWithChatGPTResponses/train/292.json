    "problem": "In a certain colony of bacteria, the number of bacteria doubles every day. The colony starts with 3 bacteria, and has 6 at the end of day 1, 12 at the end of day 2, and so on. What is the number of the first day which ends with the colony having more than 100 bacteria?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The number of bacteria is multiplied by 2 at the end of each day, so the number of bacteria at the end of day $n$ is $3\\cdot2^n$. We want $3\\cdot2^n > 100$, or $2^n > 33\\frac{1}{3}$. The smallest $n$ for which this happens is $n = \\boxed{6}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Let's assume that the number of bacteria at the end of day $n$ is $a_n$. From the problem we know that $a_{n+1}=2\\cdot a_{n}$, for any nonnegative integer $n$. Using this recursion, we can find $a_1=2\\cdot 3=6$, $a_2=2\\cdot 6=12$, $a_3=2\\cdot 12=24$, $a_4=2\\cdot 24=48$, and so on.\n\nWe see that $a_n=2^{n-1}\\cdot 3$. We want to find the smallest $n$ such that $a_n=2^{n-1}\\cdot 3>100$. If we divide both sides of the inequality by 3, we get $2^{n-1}>33\\frac{1}{3}$. Since $2^5=32$, we need $n-1>5$, or $n>6$. Therefore, the smallest value of $n$ that satisfies the inequality is $\\boxed{7}$."
