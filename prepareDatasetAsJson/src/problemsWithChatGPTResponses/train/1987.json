    "problem": "Find the intersection of the lines $9x-4y=30$ and $7x+y=11.$ Express your answer as an ordered pair $(x,y).$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can find $x$ by taking four times the second equation plus the first: $$4(7x+y)+(9x-4y)=28x+9x=37x=4(11)+30=74\\implies x=2.$$Substituting into the second equation, we can find $y:$ $$7x+y=11\\implies y=11-7x=11-7(2)=-3.$$Thus our answer is $\\boxed{(2,-3)}.$",
    "chatgpt_solution": "To find the intersection of the lines, we can solve the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n9x-4y&=30, \\\\\n7x+y&=11.\n\\end{align*} To eliminate $y,$ we can multiply the first equation by $7$ and the second equation by $-4,$ then add the resulting equations.  This gives us \\begin{align*}\n63x-28y&=210, \\\\\n-28x-4y&=-44.\n\\end{align*} Adding these equations, we get $35x = 166,$ so $x = \\frac{166}{35} = \\frac{166}{5 \\cdot 7} = \\frac{166}{5^2 \\cdot 7}.$  Hence, $y = 11-7x = 11 - 7 \\cdot \\frac{166}{5^2 \\cdot 7} = \\boxed{\\frac{4224}{5^2 \\cdot 7}}.$"
