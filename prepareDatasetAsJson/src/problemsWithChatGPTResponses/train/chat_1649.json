                "content": "Rewriting decimals as fractions is often helpful, so we have $$\\frac{76}{100}=\\frac{4b+19}{6b+11}.$$Cross-multiplying gives $76(6b+11)=(4b+19)(100),$ or $2(6b+11)=(4b+19)(\\frac{50}{19}).$ Expanding both sides gives $12b+22=10.53(4b+19),$ so $12b+22=42.12b+201.27.$ Now, moving the terms with $b$ to one side of the equation gives $0=30.12b+179.27.$ Now, isolating $b$ gives $-30.12b=179.27,$ so dividing by $-30.12$ gives $b=\\frac{179.27}{-30.12}\\approx \\boxed{-5.952}.$However, we note that if we plug this value back into the equation, we \"get\" $0.76,$ so we know $b\\approx -5.952$ is incorrect. Rather, we should try cleaning up the equation and evaluating again.Instead substituting $b=\\frac{-179.27}{30.12},$we get $b=\\frac{-179.27}{30.12}=-5.95$ to three decimal places. When we plug this into the equation with the decimal, we get $0.76=\\frac{4\\left(\\frac{-179.27}{30.12}\\right)+19}{6\\left(\\frac{-179.27}{30.12}\\right)+11},$ or $0.76=\\frac{4\\cdot -5.95+19}{6\\cdot -5.95+11},$ which gives $0.76=0.76.$ Thus, our answer is $b=\\boxed{\\textbf{(5)}}.$",
