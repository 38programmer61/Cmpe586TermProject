    "solution": "We might try to factor the quadratic, but unfortunately that doesn't get us anywhere.  Instead, we start by subtracting $5t$ from both sides so as to isolate the fraction. This gives us  \\[\\frac{13t^2 -34t + 12}{3t-2 } = t-1.\\]Multiplying both sides by $3t-2$ gives  \\[13t^ 2-34t + 12 = (t-1)(3t-2).\\]Expanding the right side gives $13t^2 - 34t + 12 = 3t^2 -5t+2$, so  $10t^2 -29t +10 = 0$. Factoring gives $(2t - 5)(5t-2)=0$, which has solutions $t=2/5$ and $t=5/2$.  The largest of these is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We begin by subtracting $5t$ and $6t$ from both sides: \\[\\frac{13t^2 - 34t + 12}{3t - 2} = -1.\\]Since we are dealing with a fraction, we take cases on the denominator of the fraction. There are two possible cases: $3t-2 = 0$ and $3t-2 \\neq 0.$\n\nIf $3t - 2 = 0,$ then $t = \\tfrac{2}{3}.$  We notice that $t = \\tfrac{2}{3}$ satisfies the original equation. (If a root is extraneous, it will not work in the original equation.)\n\nIf $3t-2\\neq0,$ then \\[\\frac{13t^2-34t+12}{3t-2} = -1 \\implies 13t^2 - 34t + 12 = -3t + 2.\\]Combining like terms, we get $13t^2 - 31t + 10 = 0.$ By the quadratic formula,  \\[t = \\frac{31\\pm\\sqrt{31^2-4\\cdot13\\cdot10}}{26},\\]and it is easy to check that both values of $t$ satisfy the original equation. (Note that in fact both roots turn out to be less than $\\tfrac23.$)\n\nIn summary, the solutions are $t = \\boxed{\\frac23}.$"
