    "problem": "If $f(1)=5$, $f(2)=8$ and $f(x)=ax+bx+2$, what is the value of $f(3)$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "By the definition of $f(x)$, we have $f(3) = 3a+3b + 2$, so if we find $3a+3b$, we can find $f(3)$. Since $f(1) = a+b+2$ (by the definition of $f(x)$) and $f(1) = 5$, we have $a+b+2 = 5$, so $a+b = 3$.  Multiplying this by 3 gives $3a+3b = 9$, so $f(3) = 3a+3b + 2 = 9+2 = \\boxed{11}$.   Notice that we didn't even need the information about $f(2)$!",
    "chatgpt_solution": "By substitution and simplification, we have that $f(3) = 3a + 3b + 2$. From the first equation, $f(1) = a + b + 2 = 5$. From the second equation, $f(2) = 2a + 2b + 2 = 8$. Multiplying the second equation by $-1$ gives $-2a - 2b - 2 = -8 \\Longleftrightarrow 2a + 2b + 2 = 8$. Since we have that $3a + 3b + 2$ equals both $8$ and $3a + 3b + 2$, it follows that $f(3)=\\boxed{8}.$"
