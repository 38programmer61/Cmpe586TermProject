    "problem": "What value of $x$ makes the equation below true: $$2x + 4 = |{-17 + 3}|$$",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Note that $|{-17 + 3}| = |{-14}| = 14$.  Thus we must solve $2x + 4 = 14$, which is the same as $2x = 10$, or $x = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "We simplify the right side of the equation to get  \\begin{align*}\n|{-17 + 3}| &= |{-14}| \\\\\n&= 14.\n\\end{align*}So we have $2x + 4 = 14$. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives $2x=10$, and dividing both sides by 2 gives $x=\\boxed{5}$."
