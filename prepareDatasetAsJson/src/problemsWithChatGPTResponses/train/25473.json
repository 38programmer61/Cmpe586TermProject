    "problem": "Joann rode her bike at an average speed of 12 miles per hour for three and a half hours. If her friend, Fran, rides for 3 hours, at what average speed, in miles per hour, would she have to ride her bike to travel the same distance that Joann traveled?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "In $3\\frac{1}{2}$ hours, Joann covers $\\left(3\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ hours}\\right)(12\\text{ mph})=42$ miles.  If Fran's average speed in miles per hour is $s$, then Fran covers $3s$ miles in $3$ hours.  Solving $3s=42$ we find $s=\\boxed{14}$ miles per hour.",
    "chatgpt_solution": "Joann's total distance is 12 miles/hour * 3.5 hours = <<12*3.5=42>>42 miles\nFran's average speed would have to be 42 miles/3 hours = <<42/3=14>>14 miles/hour. Answer: \\boxed{14}."
