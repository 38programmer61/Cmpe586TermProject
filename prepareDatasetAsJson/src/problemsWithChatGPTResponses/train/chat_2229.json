                "content": "Since the quadratic is factorable into two linear factors, it follows that the quadratic $5x^2+nx+48$ can be written in the form \\[(5x+a)(x+b)\\] for some integers $a$ and $b$. Expanding the right-hand side of this equation gives \\[5x^2+ax+5bx+ab.\\]Therefore, we must have $ax+5bx = nx$ and $5x^2 + ab = 48$. Since the coefficient of $x^2$ is 5, we must have $a=5$. The second equation then becomes \\[5x^2 + 5b = 5(x^2 + b) = 48,\\]which implies $x^2+b = 48/5 = 9.6$. The largest possible value is 9, so we obtain \\[n = ax + 5b = 5(3)+5(9) = \\boxed{60}.\\]",
